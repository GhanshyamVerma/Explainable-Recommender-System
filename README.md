# Knowledge Graph Driven Reinforcement Learning Based Recommender System
This approach mainly has 5 modules, preprocessing and kg creation, generating kg embedding, training reinforcement learning agent, recommending items for customers, and path generation and evaluation.

## How to run the code 

Run the below three .ipynb files in the same order as they are listed.

1. Preprocess the data:

run the processing.ipynb file

2. KG creation, embeddings generation, and model building:

run the KG_RL_Rec_Sys.ipynb file

3. Evaluation and Path generation:

run evaluation.ipynb
