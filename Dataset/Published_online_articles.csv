 *  The rungs help to manage interest rate and reinvestment risk.
 *  Build with diverse, high-quality, noncallable bonds.
 *  Fidelity's Bond Ladder Tool can help. Investors looking for steady income have plenty of options, from a simple CD to different flavors of annuities, individual bonds, separately managed accounts, or professionally managed mutual funds. One other option is the bond ladder.

Like all these options, bond ladders have their advantages and disadvantages, but many investors decide to build a bond ladder because it can help to customize a stream of income and manage some of the risks of changing interest rates.

Interest rate risk is the potential for rising rates to cause the prices of bonds to fall. While many investors can live with rate risk in exchange for the benefits bonds can provide a diversified portfolio, uncertainty about rates can be unnerving, especially for investors who look to bonds to create a stream of income. Bond ladders may help to manage these concerns by creating a predictable stream of income.

""Laddering bonds may be appealing because it may help you to manage interest rate risk, and to make ongoing reinvestment decisions over time, giving you the flexibility to invest in different credit and interest rate environments,"" says Richard Carter, Fidelity vice president of fixed income products and services.

It's worth noting however, that bond ladders don't completely eliminate rate risk, the price of bonds in the ladder continues to fluctuate as rates change, and an investor will still face periodic reinvestment risk for some portion of the portfolio. Managing reinvestment risk Interest payments from the bonds in a ladder can provide scheduled cash flows. In addition, the ladder can help you manage reinvestment risk. What is reinvestment risk? Say you invest in an individual bond. That bond eventually would mature, the issuer would return your principal, and you'd have to purchase a new bond if you wanted to continue generating income or maintain your portfolio's asset allocation mix. But if interest rates and bond yields had decreased in the meantime, you wouldn’t be able to generate as much income as before with the same amount invested in a similar quality bond. That’s a predicament some investors who rely on investment income won't want to find themselves in.

Building a bond ladder has the potential to diversify this reinvestment risk across a number of bonds that mature at different intervals. Imagine that yields fall as one rung in your ladder approaches maturity. If you choose to reinvest, you will have to invest only a fraction of your bond portfolio at the lower rate. Meanwhile, the other bonds in the portfolio will continue generating income at the relatively higher older rates. So the impact of falling rates may be smaller with a ladder than with a bullet strategy that targets a single maturity date or than with an investment in a small number of bonds.

What if yields and interest rates increase? A bond ladder regularly frees up a slice of your portfolio, so you can take advantage of the new, higher rates. If you have all your money invested in a ""bullet"" strategy, with a single maturity date, you might be able to reinvest at higher yields. But what if your bonds didn't reach maturity while rates are higher? If none of your holdings mature during the time of higher rates—you might miss out.

""A bond ladder gives you a framework in which to balance the reinvestment opportunities of short-term bonds with the potentially higher yields that longer-term bonds typically offer,"" says Carter.

Having a well-diversified bond ladder does not guarantee that you will avoid a loss, but it can help protect you the way that any diversified portfolio does, by helping to manage the risk of any single investment. Bond ladder considerations While building a bond ladder may help you manage interest rate and reinvestment risk to some extent, there are 6 important guidelines to consider to make sure you are diversified and to attempt to protect yourself from undue credit risk. 1. Hold bonds until they reach maturity It's important that you have enough money set aside to meet your short-term needs and deal with emergencies. You should also have a temperament that will allow you to ride out the ups and downs of the market. That’s because many of the benefits of bond ladders—such as an income plan and managing interest rate and credit risk—are based on the idea that you keep your bonds in your portfolio until they mature. If you sell early—either because you need cash or you change your investment plans—you will be exposed to additional risks, including the risks of loss or decreased yield from your ladder. In fact, if you don't hold bonds to maturity, you may experience similar interest-rate risk as a comparable-duration bond fund. So, if you don't know how long you can hold the bonds, you may want to consider a shorter ladder, or a bond mutual fund. 2. Make sure you have enough money invested to diversify<sup>*</sup> Because bonds are often sold in minimum denominations of $1,000 or $5,000, it can take a substantial investment to achieve diversification. It may make sense to have at least $500,000 in bond investments in your long-term investment mix.

If you are investing in corporate bonds, particularly lower-quality corporate bonds, the number of issuers needed to diversify a ladder across sectors and issuers becomes even greater.

The table to the right offers some illustration of how many different issuers may be required to help achieve diversification at different credit ratings. 3. Build your ladder with high-credit-quality bonds Because the purpose of a bond ladder is to provide predictable income over a long period of time, taking excessive amounts of credit risk probably doesn't make sense. So you may want to consider only higher-quality bonds. You can use ratings as a starting point to find those bonds. For instance, select only bonds rated ""A"" or better. But even ratings have limits; they could change or be outdated, so you should do additional research to ensure you are comfortable investing in a security you are intending to hold for potentially many years. The bonds in a ladder are intended to be held until maturity, so price declines caused by rating downgrades generally won't affect the income stream, though it will impact the underlying value of the ladder. Higher-quality bonds offer another advantage as well: These investments typically come with lower transaction costs, which can help manage the expenses associated with this strategy. 4. Avoid the highest-yielding bonds at any given credit rating You may feel tempted to choose the highest-yielding bonds for whatever credit rating or maturity you have chosen, figuring they represent a bargain—more yield for the same amount of risk.

Resist that temptation. You need to understand why a bond is offering a higher yield. An unusually high yield relative to similar bonds is often an indication that the market is anticipating a downgrade or perceives that bond to have more risk than the others and therefore has traded the bond’s price down (thereby increasing its yield). That can happen in advance of an official downgrade and may be too risky for your ladder. One potential exception is that in the municipal bond market, buyers often pay a premium for the most familiar issuers, meaning that higher yields may be available from smaller issuers. 5. Keep callable bonds out of your ladder Part of the beauty of a bond ladder is the scheduled cash flow; you know when the bonds will mature and you know how much you will need to reinvest. But when a bond is called prior to maturity, its interest payments cease and the principal is returned as of the call date—altering both your cash flow schedule and the schedule of principal coming due. You may want to select bonds that can’t be called away early. 6. Think about time and frequency Another important feature of a bond ladder is the total length of time the ladder will cover and the number of rungs, or how often the bonds in the ladder are scheduled to mature, returning your principal. A ladder with more rungs will require a larger investment but will provide a greater range of maturities, and if you choose to reinvest, this means you will have more opportunities to gain exposure to future interest rate environments. A case study: building a bond ladder To see how you can build a ladder using Fidelity's Bond Ladder Tool, let's take a hypothetical case in which Matt wants to invest $100,000 to produce a stream of income for about 10 years. Matt decides to start with his investment amount—though the tool would have let him target a level of income as well. He sets his timeline and asks for a ladder with 9 rungs of about $11,000 each. Then he chooses bond types. In order to be broadly diversified, the rungs each contain a range of bonds and FDIC-insured CDs at different credit rating levels, but all of them are at least investment grade. Matt elects the option to have the tool suggest bonds for each rung. So on the next screen, the tool suggests a bond for each rung of the ladder and shows a summary of the ladder, including the expected yield and annual interest payments. (Note: The screenshot below is incomplete and only shows 2 of the rungs.) Another view lets Matt review the schedule of when to expect interest payments and the return of principal—providing a view into the cash flow he could expect if he chooses to purchase the suggested bond ladder. Matt's expected cash flows appear to decrease over time, as successive rungs of bonds mature, but he may be able to extend that income by reinvesting the returned principal each time one of the bonds matures."

 *  The ""stretch IRA"" provision has generally been eliminated for non-spousal IRAs. For IRAs inherited from original owners who have passed away on or after January 1, 2020, the new law requires many beneficiaries to withdraw all assets from an inherited IRA or 401(k) plan within 10 years following the death of the account holder.
 *  In some cases, it may make sense to disclaim inherited IRA assets because they could increase the total amount of your estate and exceed estate tax exemption limits.

If you are the son, daughter, brother, sister, or even a close friend of an IRA owner who has named you as their beneficiary, it's critical that you—and the owner of the IRA—understand the rules that govern IRA inheritances. ""Some of the rules for inheriting and distributing assets upon the death of an IRA owner changed with the passage of the SECURE Act in December 2019,"" says Ken Hevert, senior vice president of retirement products at Fidelity. ""If IRA owners and their beneficiaries are not careful, they could end up paying higher taxes or penalties and forfeiting the opportunity for future tax-advantaged growth.""

Here is what you need to know about inheriting IRA assets as a nonspouse beneficiary. The rules for inheriting IRA assets depend on your relationship to the original IRA owner and the type of IRA inherited. Whatever your situation, a discussion in advance with your attorney or tax advisor may help you avoid any unintended consequences.

The IRS generally requires nonspouse inherited IRA owners to start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) no later than December 31 in the year following the death of the original account owner. Distributions taken from inherited IRAs are not subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty in most cases.

With the passage of the SECURE Act, IRA distributions to a nonspouse must be completed within 10 years following the death of the account owner. Previously, if you inherited an IRA or 401(k), you could potentially ""stretch"" your distributions and tax payments out over your single life expectancy. The SECURE Act has eliminated this so-called ""stretch"" provision for certain beneficiaries.

As a nonspouse beneficiary, you do not have the option of rolling the assets into your own IRA. If you inherit IRA assets from someone other than your spouse, you have several options: 1. Transfer the assets to an inherited IRA and take RMDs When a traditional IRA is transferred into an inherited IRA, sometimes also referred to as a beneficiary distribution account, there are RMD rules to follow, set by the IRS. Your options for taking distributions from the IRA are based on when the original IRA owner died.

**If the original IRA owner died before December 31, 2019, and**

 *  **Died before reaching age 70½,** you can start taking RMDs no later than December 31 of the year following death. You also have the option of distributing your inherited IRA under the 5-year rule. This allows you to take distributions however you like without penalty, so long as all assets are completely distributed from your inherited IRA by December 31 of the 5th year following the IRA owner’s death. Discuss with your tax advisor the potential tax implications of this accelerated withdrawal schedule.
 *  **Died after reaching age 70½,** you may elect to calculate those RMDs by using your own age or by using the original IRA owner's age in their year of death, whichever was longer. This option may be advantageous if the original IRA owner was younger than you. In the case of a nonspouse inheritor, RMDs are generally required to begin in the year after the year of death.

**If the original IRA owner died on or after January 1, 2020**

 *  The SECURE Act requires beneficiaries to withdraw all assets from an inherited IRA or 401(k) plan by December 31 of the 10th year following the IRA owner's death. Exceptions to the 10-year rule include payments made to an eligible designated beneficiary (a surviving spouse, a minor child of the account owner, a disabled or chronically ill beneficiary, and a beneficiary who is not more than 10 years younger than the original IRA owner or 401(k) participant). These beneficiaries can ""stretch"" payments over their life expectancy. Discuss the potential tax implications and distribution options of this accelerated withdrawal schedule with your tax advisor.

**If you are listed as a nonspouse beneficiary along with one or more other beneficiaries**, it's important to separate your portion of the decedent's IRA in your name and then complete your first RMD by December 31 of the year following the original IRA owner's death. If you don't meet this deadline, your RMD calculation will be based on the oldest beneficiary's life expectancy. If that person is older than you are, you will need to take a larger distribution.

If you inherit a Roth IRA that was funded for 5 years or more prior to the death of the original owner, distributions can be taken tax-free. Consult a tax advisor if you've inherited a Roth IRA that wasn't funded for 5 years before the original owner passed away.

What to do with the money? If you don’t have an immediate need for the money, leaving the assets in the inherited IRA may be the wisest move over the long term (again, subject to the RMD rules and other considerations, including changes to your tax bracket). This is because the longer you keep the money there, the longer you will enjoy potential tax-deferred growth, or, in the case of an inherited Roth IRA, potential tax-free growth. On the other hand, when you take money out of an inherited IRA, it will generally be taxed as ordinary income. The more you withdraw from an inherited IRA now, the less you will have to build on for the future. 2. Disclaim (decline to inherit) all or part of the assets If you decline to accept all or part of the IRA assets you are entitled to, they will pass to the other eligible beneficiaries. If no other beneficiaries exist, the assets will pass in accordance with the IRA provider's custodial agreement. For example, with a Fidelity IRA, the assets will pass to the original IRA owner's surviving spouse and, if none, to the owner's estate. A decision to disclaim IRA assets must be made within 9 months of the original IRA owner's death and before you take possession of the assets. This is an irrevocable decision. Therefore, as with any tax-related or estate planning matter, it's critical that you consult a tax advisor or attorney before disclaiming IRA assets. Other key points to remember **Determine whether you are listed as someone's beneficiary.** While it may be a sensitive topic to broach with loved ones, knowing in advance that you are listed as a beneficiary can be helpful. As life events such as marriage, divorce, and death occur, it's in your best interest (and the IRA owner's) to confirm that beneficiary designations are up to date. Remember that IRA beneficiary designations supersede a will.

**Request a trustee-to-trustee transfer.** Make sure that any assets transfer directly from one account to another or from one IRA custodian to another. There is no option for a 60-day rollover when a nonspouse beneficiary is inheriting IRA assets. If you receive a check, the money will generally be taxed as ordinary income, and is ineligible to be deposited into an inherited IRA you may own at another firm, or back into the inherited IRA that it was withdrawn from to begin with.

**Distributions from an inherited IRA can be invested in other accounts.** Consider all your options when taking RMDs and other distributions from an inherited IRA. Generally, your distribution is included in your gross income and will be subject to ordinary state and federal income taxes. Once funds are distributed from an inherited account, the money is your own.

**Commingling of inherited IRAs.** If you inherit IRAs from different owners, you cannot combine them into a single inherited IRA. As for commingling IRAs of the same account type, the answer differs when they were inherited from the same original owner, which is allowed. Consult a tax advisor regarding your situation. Distribution rules will vary for entities such as trusts, estates, and charities.

**Nonspouse beneficiaries do not have bankruptcy protection with inherited IRAs.** In 2005, the US Supreme Court ruled that an inherited IRA held by a nonspouse beneficiary is not exempt from attachment by creditors under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. While some states have laws that still may protect inherited IRAs, for a nonspouse beneficiary living in a state without such laws, the inherited IRA is effectively now treated as any other account owned by the beneficiary for bankruptcy purposes, and may not be protected under bankruptcy from claims by creditors. It is not clear whether and how this decision affects an inherited IRA held by a spousal beneficiary. Beneficiaries should be reminded to speak with their attorney or tax advisor before taking any distribution from a retirement account or if they have specific questions regarding protection from creditors."

| Your brokerage firm may offer many of the same services you can find at a bank. Plus, it may be a convenient way to manage your money—in one place.  Credit unions also offer banking services—with potentially fewer fees than banks.  Banks are still good for loans and most have convenient locations for in-person transactions, but mobile banking has made the brick-and-mortar bank less vital. |  | Stopping by the local bank branch used to be part of most Americans' everyday routine, like picking up milk and bread at the grocery store. But changes in technology have made banks less central in many people’s lives. Plus, banks now have more competition when it comes to basic banking services.

In addition to online banks, community banks, and credit unions, many brokerage firms have started offering their customers a range of financial services that are similar to those found at conventional banks—and Fidelity is one of them. ""Brokerages have come to believe they can offer many of the services a bank would offer, either directly or through third-party arrangements,"" says Erik Lind, vice president of cash management products at Fidelity Investments. ""These include the ability to write checks against brokerage accounts and link debit cards to those accounts for easier access via either ATMs or point-of-sale transactions, or through brokerage accounts that have been set up to act like checking accounts.""

""Some brokerage firms have also introduced enhanced cash management services, including mobile deposit and bill payment functionality, to better compete with banks,"" says Lind.

Banks have expanded their services too. Services such as retirement planning, asset allocation, and managed accounts—all previously available primarily at brokerage firms—can now be found at some banks. You may not even miss your bank Fewer people make trips to the bank these days. Indeed, it's hard to remember when it was necessary to visit a branch to perform a simple transaction like a funds transfer. Now most transactions, including mobile check deposits, can be completed with the tap of a finger or a click of a mouse. As a result, banks across the country are closing branches, citing the high costs of operating those branches and the decline in traffic from customers at their branches. Banking services offered by brokerage firms A decade ago, the financial crisis brought challenges and opportunities to the financial services industry. ""Brokerage firms saw a great opportunity to look at their services and find ways to close the gap with banks,"" says Lind. Now you can get some bread-and-butter banking services at the same place you hold your investments accounts.

**FDIC insurance****.** Bank accounts are FDIC insured up to $250,000.<sup>1</sup> But at some brokerage firms (Fidelity included), it is now possible to have uninvested cash balances swept to multiple banks, making those balances eligible for well over $1 million of FDIC insurance coverage.<sup>2</sup> ""If you wanted to do that directly at a bank, you'd have to set up differently titled accounts or have your funds literally placed in different banks,"" says Lind.

""A more convenient way to gain the expanded coverage may be to open one account at a brokerage provider that can automatically cascade your assets throughout its bank network coverage, rather than having separate deposits in a bank or multiple banks,"" says Lind.

**Cash management services.** Brokerage firms don't have as many branches as most major banks, so in the days before online banking, it was difficult for them to offer services that required initial branch visits, such as direct deposit or bill payment. Now that online and mobile banking is widespread, some brokerage firms offer a wide range of services, including direct deposit, mobile deposit, and online and mobile bill payment, as well as check writing capabilities and debit cards linked to brokerage accounts, most of which previously were solely the domain of banks.

**Credit cards linked to investment accounts.** Some brokerage firms partner with third parties to offer their customers credit cards that may provide a boost to an individual's investment account. For example, clients using a brokerage-linked credit card might accumulate cash rewards that are deposited in their retirement or investment accounts.

**Relief from fees.** Fees can add up. The average monthly checking account maintenance fee is about $5.57. ATM fees for noncustomers to use bank ATMs average $4.68, according to Bankrate.<sup>3</sup>

There are ways to get around bank fees—not all checking accounts charge maintenance fees or they are waived after jumping over some low hurdles such as setting up direct deposit.

You can also shop around for low or no-fee options like those offered by online banks, community banks, credit unions, and brokerage firms where you may find debit cards, checkwriting, bill pay services, and reimbursement of ATM fees.

**Trouble-free transfers to brokerage accounts.** Some brokerage firms allow their clients to link checking and other banking accounts with their investment accounts. This arrangement simplifies the process of transferring money in and out of brokerage accounts—giving clients access to their cash when they need it, or enabling them to add to their investment portfolio quickly and easily. Moreover, consumers can arrange for brokerage assets to cover overdrafts on checking accounts, potentially avoiding steep fees.

Traditional banking features can even be added to brokerage accounts—letting you write checks, pay with a digital wallet, or pay bills straight from your investment account. Some benefits of banks Despite the expanded offerings of brokerage firms, banks provide some services that are difficult to find elsewhere. These include:

**Availability of personal loans.** Most notably, businesses and consumers looking for personal loans are typically best off heading to a bank. ""Brokerage firms generally are not in a position to provide this type of consumer lending,"" says Lind. This means any consumer who needs a mortgage, car loan, home equity loan, or personal loan is likely to require the services of a traditional bank or a specialty online provider of these lending products.

**A way to establish credit.** If you're trying to establish credit or get a loan with a scarce credit history, having an established banking relationship with the lender may help you get a loan. It's not a sure thing, of course, but it could be one mark in your favor. A good credit record means that you have a better chance of qualifying for a loan, and possibly getting a better (meaning lower) interest rate on a loan. This means that you may be able to pay less money (in interest) for the amount of any money you have to borrow.

**A sense of comfort and tradition.** Many bank customers are just more accustomed to walking into a bank or using their bank's online services. Some people may feel more comfortable with bank services and like having their money in one place. Other people are just reluctant to change their banking practices, or they may value a nearby, in-branch relationship that may be easier to find at a local bank.

Plus, banks with local branches do usually offer some convenient services to customers, like having a notary public on staff and free cashier's checks. Be sure to weigh the pros and cons of any change So do you still need a bank? Like most financial decision-making, there is no one right answer, just the answer that is right for your particular needs and circumstances. Before making any decision, it's important to weigh the pros and cons. The changes in the financial services industry have brought more options to consumers, which means you get to choose the banking relationship that works for you."
3,9893,Beware of cashing out a 401(k),['Saving for Retirement'],"['401(k)', 'IRA', 'Retirement Accounts', 'Rollover IRA', 'Roth IRA', 'Traditional IRA']","['Investing strategies', 'Retirement', 'Tax efficient investing', 'Taxes']","['401(k)', 'IRA', 'Retirement accounts', 'Rollover IRA', 'Roth IRA']",Beware of cashing out a 401(k),Beware of cashing out a 401(k),Beware of cashing out,Evaluate all of your options before cashing out a 401(k).,Evaluate all of your options before cashing out a 401(k).,It might be tempting to withdraw some money when times are tough—but there could be long-term consequences.," Key takeaways  *  There can be an immediate cost to cashing out a 401(k): federal and state income tax, and for those younger than 59½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty.
 *  If you run into financial trouble, a loan from your 401(k) may be an option. A hardship withdrawal (if the plan offers it) could be as well.
 *  Long-term consequences include the lost opportunity for tax-deferred growth. Have you ever cashed out your 401(k) when changing jobs? If so, you may have been stunned to find an incredibly shrunken balance, the victim of taxes and early withdrawal penalties that can approach 50% for people in the top income tax bracket.

All too often, people make that painful mistake when managing their 401(k) savings—they cash out. Fidelity data finds that 1 in 3 investors has cashed out of their 401(k) before reaching age 59½, often when changing jobs. Long-term consequences For many, cashing out a 401(k) seems like a relatively easy way to solve a short-term cash crunch, whether it's due to temporary cash-flow problems created by the loss of a job, or simply paying down a credit card or covering an emergency home repair. But while doing so may not seem like a big deal, especially if you have a small balance, over a long period of time, the consequences of cashing out can be significant.

""Once you withdraw those savings, they’re gone from your plan—and they can be very difficult to replace,"" says Ken Hevert, Fidelity senior vice president of retirement products. ""While it can be pretty tempting to cash out your 401(k) and use the money to pay off a car or your credit card bill, you may want to think twice before doing so, and weigh the impact of that decision.""

The power of tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s is that they allow contributions to be made pretax and allow for tax-deferred compounding (in the case of traditional 401(k)s) or for Roth accounts, they allow tax-exempt compounding and withdrawals.\* In either case, your contributions have the potential to compound without taxes eroding that growth. Over time, earnings can generate their own earnings, helping you accumulate more money than you would in an ordinary taxable account. Younger investors who cash out lose that opportunity, potentially setting their retirement savings back considerably. The average cash-out amount for those changing jobs under age 40 is $14,300, according to a Fidelity study on 401(k) participants.

Older 401(k) investors who choose to cash out may be eliminating a key part of their retirement income picture. The older a 401(k) investor is when withdrawing assets—and therefore subjecting those assets to taxes and potential penalties—the less likely they may be to generate a sustainable income in a retirement that could last 25 years or more. Older investors may have higher balances with larger tax liabilities, plus they may have fewer years to recover their savings before retirement.

If you've run into financial trouble and need money, and have no other recourse, consider taking a loan from your 401(k) if your plan allows it. A 401(k) loan will let you pay yourself back with interest, plus you get to avoid paying taxes and penalties.

If you're able to keep up your saving while you pay the loan back, the impact on your retirement may be relatively minimal—especially compared to cashing out.

Before taking out a loan, it’s important to know that if you leave your job, voluntarily or otherwise, you will have to pay back the loan in full or report it as income and pay taxes and a potential 10% early distribution penalty. But you do potentially have some time to come up with the money. You’ll have until the tax-filing deadline (with extensions) for the year you left the job, or when the loan offsets, to roll over the balance of your former loan. If you left your job in December 2019 and the loan was offset in February 2020, you would have until October 15, 2020.

You can repay yourself by rolling your account out of your former employer’s plan and into an IRA or a new employer’s plan. If you are able to put the outstanding amount of the loan back (the amount of the loan offset) into an eligible retirement plan within the allowed time frame, no taxes or penalties would be due.

A hardship withdrawal may be an option as well if it's allowed by your plan. A withdrawal will be subject to taxes and may be subject to the 10% penalty unless you qualify for an exception. Taxes and early 401(k) withdrawal penalty There also is an immediate cost to cashing out. For one, it can generate a large tax bill. Your plan administrator is typically required to automatically withhold 20% of your withdrawal and send it directly to the IRS to cover the federal income taxes you may need to pay on that withdrawal. ""That means you just gave the IRS a huge chunk of the money you've been saving for years,"" says Hevert. ""That's money you're no longer saving for retirement."" In addition to federal and state income tax, investors younger than 59½ who cash out may have to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Substantially equal periodic payments There is a way to take distributions from your retirement account that avoids the 10% penalty but it’s a bit complicated and it’s a long-term commitment.

You can avoid the early withdrawal penalty by arranging to take ""substantially equal periodic payments"" from the account. The amounts of your withdrawals are based on your age and account balance.

There are 3 methods of calculating the amount allowed by the IRS: required minimum distribution, fixed amortization, and fixed annuitization. You must take at least 1 withdrawal per year for 5 years or until you reach age 59½, whichever is longer.

If you’re interested, consider this calculator: [Substantially equal Periodic Payments / 72(t) Calculator.](https://calculators.wealthmsi.com/fidelity/c72t)

Not all workplace savings accounts allow substantially equal periodic payments so you would have to check with your plan administrator. Alternatives to cashing out Fortunately, there are easy alternatives to liquidating your 401(k) that keep your savings intact—and, potentially, growing. If you've left a job and are considering what to do with your 401(k), here are the options:

**A traditional IRA rollover.** In both traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts, contributions and earnings can grow tax-free until you begin making withdrawals, when you'll pay income tax on those distributions.

The rollover process is relatively easy—but every plan has different rules and the process can vary. Be sure to request a direct rollover, whereby a check is made payable directly to your IRA provider. ""The benefit of a direct rollover is that taxes will not be withheld,"" says Hevert.

You can also choose to do an indirect rollover, in which a check is made payable to you. However, in this case it's up to you to make sure the money finds its way to a tax-advantaged account such as a traditional or Roth IRA.

When you cash out your plan in an indirect rollover, your 401(k) administrator may withhold 20% of your pre-tax account balance. You may need to come up with that 20% out of your own pocket to put the full amount of your 401(k) balance into your IRA. Otherwise, the IRS may categorize the difference between your plan balance and your rollover contribution as a withdrawal—even though they actually have possession of that money in the form of withholding.

This process can be complicated, and any missteps may trigger penalties and taxes. For example, if you don’t deposit the money into a tax-advantaged account within 60 days, it may be taxed as a withdrawal. ""With an indirect rollover, it's up to you to prove at tax time that you did everything right,"" says Hevert. ""With a direct rollover, you don’t have to deal with that.""

**A Roth IRA rollover.** You may choose to roll your 401(k) directly into a Roth IRA to take advantage of the tax-free growth and withdrawals offered by these accounts. That move may trigger a sizable tax bill. You'll generally owe taxes on the 401(k) amount you convert to a Roth if you made only pretax contributions to the 401(k).

Say you have $100,000 in a 401(k). Rolling the money into a Roth IRA may lead to a tax bill of up to $37,000 in federal income taxes, and you may owe state/local income taxes as well, depending on where you live. In that case, it's often a good idea to pay the tax out of your own savings, if possible, rather than dipping into your tax-advantaged retirement savings. ""After all, you want to keep as much of your retirement savings intact as possible,"" says Hevert.

A Roth conversion may make sense for people who expect to face higher taxes in retirement. But there are other factors to consider, such as the other accounts you hold and your individual retirement goals. Consider meeting with a financial advisor or your tax professional to discuss the short- and long-term pros and cons of rolling your 401(k) savings into a Roth IRA.

**Stick with a 401(k).** Leaving a former employer doesn't necessarily mean you have to leave that company's retirement plan. Many plans allow former employees to leave their 401(k) account active even after they leave the company.

Keep in mind that you won't be able to make new contributions to that plan or benefit from any employer matches. But your money will still enjoy the tax-deferred growth in that plan and you'll be able to keep your investments. Check with your plan administrator to learn more about the rules, fees, and expenses. For example, many plans require that accounts smaller than $5,000 be cashed out or rolled over.

Another option is to roll your old plan balance into your new employer's plan. Doing so can make it easier to keep track of your retirement savings. Before choosing this option, review your new plan's fees, expenses, and investment options and compare them with your old plan and those in an IRA.

Here are some of the factors to consider when deciding whether to keep your savings in a 401(k) or roll the funds into an IRA.

 *  **Fees and expenses.** Compare the underlying fees and expenses of the investment options in your old and new plans with those in the IRA. Some plans offer participants access to lower-cost or plan-specific investment options. Also, consider any fees charged by the plans, such as quarterly administration fees. Those should be compared with any fees that may be assessed in the IRA. Each IRA provider's fees are different, so it is important for people to look carefully at the provider. Examples include annual fees that may be charged at the account level, fees associated with the investments, and any fees associated with services being performed by the broker-dealer.
 *  **Investment options.** In general, 401(k) plans offer a limited menu of funds, selected by the plan, while IRAs offer broad access to mutual funds and individual securities. Do-it-yourself investors may appreciate choosing from a larger universe of investments, while others may prefer the ease of choosing from a smaller menu.
 *  **Liquidity and security.** Keeping money in a 401(k) may provide protection of very large balances from creditors, whereas creditor protection for IRAs is limited to $1,362,800 as of April 2019 (the amount is adjusted every 3 years).
    
    At the same time, you may have more access and flexibility in an IRA when you need to withdraw money. For example, some 401(k) plans may not allow a partial withdrawal. Be sure you understand the rules of your 401(k) plan, as each plan can vary.

If you decide to leave money in your old 401(k), make sure you keep your personal records—from beneficiaries to contact information—updated with the plan administrator. ""You want to make sure you don't leave your money there and forget about it,"" says Hevert.

Whether you choose to move your old 401(k) to an IRA or a new 401(k), or just keep it in your old plan, the key is keeping your savings intact and benefiting from the tax-advantaged growth these plans allow. It might be tempting to withdraw some money now, but beware of cashing out your 401(k). You'll avoid the early withdrawal penalty and potentially have much more savings for your retirement. If you leave your money in your 401(k) until retirement, you'll avoid early withdrawal penalties and potentially have much more savings accumulated by the time you need to start using your 401(k) for retirement income."

 *  After you cover expected expenses, consider reinvesting RMDs in nonretirement accounts or donating to charity.
 *  Avoid IRS penalties and don't miss the deadline to take your RMD. You've saved for years to get to retirement and now that you're no longer working, it's time to dip into those savings—even if you don't really need to. Once you reach age 72, the IRS mandates you to take required minimum distributions, or RMDs, each year from traditional IRAs or employer-sponsored retirement accounts.<sup><font>2</font></sup>

""Making the best use of your RMDs can help avoid costly mistakes,"" advises Ken Hevert, senior vice president at Fidelity. ""If you don't plan to use that money for current living expenses, there are some key decisions to make—whether you want to reinvest it, give it to your heirs, or donate it to a charity.""

It's important to keep in mind that RMDs are usually taxed as ordinary income. This means that withdrawals will count toward your total taxable income for the year. They will be taxed at your applicable individual federal income tax rate and may also be subject to state and local taxes.

However, if you made after-tax contributions, part of the distribution may be nontaxable.<sup><font>3</font></sup> While Roth IRAs don't have RMDs during your lifetime, RMDs are required for Roth 401(k)s, though the distributions are typically not taxable ([see IRS chart](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/roth-comparison-chart)).

RMDs can be an important part of your retirement income plan, but they come with some strict rules, so having an RMD strategy can help. If you have assets that are subject to RMDs, here are 4 key questions to answer that can help you think through how and when to use your RMDs. 1. Do you need the money to cover living expenses? If you need RMDs to pay for current expenses, it makes sense to develop a budget in retirement. Going through the budgeting process can help you estimate living expenses, manage your cash flow, and determine if you'll need to use your RMDs to fund your retirement lifestyle.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Budgeting tips for retirees](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/budgeting-in-retirement)

""Some retirees will need RMDs to cover their ongoing retirement expenses. If you're planning to spend your RMDs, one big consideration is managing your cash flow,"" explains Hevert. ""You may want to consider having the money sent directly to a cash management or bank account that provides helpful cash management tools."" Ways to withdraw your RMD You can opt to take one-time distributions for your RMDs year after year, but the easiest way to satisfy your RMD is by setting up automatic withdrawals. This way, you avoid the potential consequences of forgetting to take your RMD. Distributions can be in the form of a check sent to you, a transfer to your bank, or the funds can easily be moved directly into your nonretirement account (brokerage or cash management account). You choose when you want to receive the funds, monthly or annually.

Regardless of the schedule, the deadline is important. You have until December 31 each year to take your RMD.<sup><font>4</font></sup> The IRS penalty for not taking an RMD, or for taking less than the required amount, is steep: 50% of the amount not taken on time.

**Tip:** Many people choose to have taxes withheld from their RMDs. If you choose not to do this, make sure you set aside money to pay the taxes, and be careful, sometimes under-withholding can result in a [tax penalty](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-required-minimum-distributions-rmds). 2. Do you plan to reinvest the money? For some retirees, pension and Social Security income may cover your expected expenses. Remember, even though you may not need RMD monies to fund your retirement spending, you're still required to take RMDs out of your applicable retirement accounts.

Although your RMD can't be reinvested back into a tax-advantaged retirement account, here are 3 options to consider for your taxable brokerage accounts:

1.  **Municipal bonds or municipal bond funds.** These pay income that is generally free from federal income tax and, in some cases, from state and local taxes. Note: Income from some municipal bonds and mutual funds is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.
2.  **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tax-managed mutual funds.** The unique structure of many ETFs may help investors by enabling them to delay realizing taxable capital gains. Tax-managed stock mutual funds as well as equity index mutual funds also tend to be tax-efficient (though there are exceptions).
3.  **Stocks you intend to hold longer than a year that pay qualified dividends.** Sales of appreciated stocks held more than a year are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. Just be sure any dividends the stock pays are qualified. Qualified dividends are taxed at the same low rates as long-term capital gains, but nonqualified ordinary dividends, such as those paid by many real estate investment trusts (REITs), are taxed at ordinary income rates.

**Tip:** If you have investments in your retirement account that may be difficult to sell, consider transferring them in-kind to a nonretirement account. This helps satisfy your RMD (you'll still owe the taxes on the distribution), but this option allows you to stay invested in the security. The cost basis on the investment in the taxable account will be reset on the day of the transfer.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [How to invest tax-efficiently](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/investing-ideas/tax-strategy) 3. Do you plan to pass money on to your heirs? If you have grandchildren that you'd like to help give a head start, consider using your RMD to fund a 529 college savings account or Roth IRA for Kids account. Another way to pass money to the next generation is to convert some of your traditional IRA assets to a Roth IRA. With this ""Roth conversion"" strategy, you'll no longer have to worry about RMDs on the amount converted, because RMDs are not required during the lifetime of the original account owner in a Roth IRA.<sup>5</sup>

Here's how it works: Say Susan hypothetically had a traditional IRA and wants her 3 children to inherit the bulk of her estate. When she converts her traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, she'll pay taxes on the conversion, reducing the size of her estate.

Her Roth IRA is not subject to any additional taxes (assuming Susan has had a Roth IRA for 5 years and doesn't make any nonqualified withdrawals) or to RMDs. Upon her death, her children would inherit their share of her Roth IRA—income tax-free.

Later on, Susan's heirs will have to take RMDs on their inherited Roth IRA each year after they inherit the account. As long as the [distributions are qualified](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/building-savings/learn-about-iras/inherited-ira-rmd), they won't be taxed on those distributions, which potentially increases the after-tax value of their inheritance.

Remember, if you're already over 72, you will have to take an RMD before you can convert to a Roth IRA. The upside is that you can then use the amount withdrawn to pay the taxes due from the conversion. However, if you anticipate that your heirs will be in a much lower tax bracket than your own, it may not make sense to convert.

While Roth IRAs are generally not subject to income tax, they are still subject to estate tax, so it is important to plan accordingly. Since there are other ways to transfer money to heirs, such as trusts and gifting, consult an estate planning advisor before making any decisions.

Know the rules](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/surviving-spouse-IRA) 4. Do you want to make charitable donations now? If you have to satisfy an RMD and you would also like to make a gift to charity, then consider a qualified charitable distribution (QCD). You may be able to kill 2 birds with one stone.

A QCD is a direct transfer of funds from your IRA custodian, payable to a qualified charity. Once you've reached age 72, the QCD amount counts toward your RMD for the year, up to an annual maximum of $100,000. It's not included in your gross income and does not count against the limits on deductions for charitable contributions. These can be significant advantages for certain high-income earners.

Due to changes enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a number of retirees may now take the standard deduction when filing taxes ($12,000 for singles; $24,000 for couples). For some, it may not make economic sense to itemize deductions on their taxes because they may not be able to get a tax deduction for a conventional charitable contribution. In such cases, QCDs—which do not depend on itemization—may be a useful alternative.

**Tip:** You don't have to wait until year-end to have a charitable planning discussion with your financial advisor. Once you reach age 72, you can do a QCD at any point throughout the year. Remember, your QCD amount will not count as an itemized deduction. The rules are complex, so be sure to consult your tax advisor. Get more information about [qualified charitable distributions](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/building-savings/learn-about-iras/required-minimum-distributions/qcds). Have a plan Whichever scenario applies to you, RMDs are likely to play an important role in your finances in retirement. Building a thoughtful retirement income plan can help you use RMDs in the most effective way, and help you reach your important financial goals. At the very least, it's important to spend some time understanding RMDs and your options with a tax professional, to ensure that you are meeting the IRS requirements—and to help avoid a costly tax mistake."

| Even if you are only about 5 years away from retirement, there's still time to hone your strategy to help meet your retirement goals.  Beyond saving more and adjusting your asset mix, postponing retirement is generally an effective step for many preretirees to accumulate more wealth.  Think through the details of your planned retirement: Where do you want to live? How will you pay for health care and other big expenses? What will you do to fill your time? |  | Chances are, you've thought about retirement quite a bit over the years, whether you've fantasized about how you'll spend your time or fretted about your 401(k) balance. If you're like most people, though, you may be a little fuzzy about what your retirement will really look like.

At some point, you'll need to bring your retirement into sharper focus. Ideally, that's about 5 (or more) years before you hope to retire, when retirement is close enough to know what you want it to look like, and yet far enough away that there’s still time to hone your strategy to help meet those goals or alter your plans.

""There are still lots of big decisions to think about 5 years out,"" says Ken Hevert, senior vice president of retirement at Fidelity. Hevert advises clearly defining how you want to spend your time, money, and energy during the next chapter in your life—and trying to enjoy the process.

Begin by asking yourself these 5 key questions: 1. What are your expectations? ""It seems like a simple question,"" says Hevert. ""But we know that more than half of couples have no idea how much they expect to receive in monthly retirement income, and most either don't know or are unsure of what their Social Security payments may be in retirement.""

This lack of planning and understanding may affect more than just your happiness in retirement; it could also affect when and how you'll be able to retire. Five years before you plan to retire may be a good time to refine your retirement planning estimates and reprioritize your goals. ""You need to do as accurate and realistic a projection as you can,"" says Hevert.

**Where do you plan to live?**
If you plan to move, make sure you also consider how that will impact your cost of living, including the cost of health care and your access to it. If you have your eyes on moving to another state, be sure you understand any differences in taxes (e.g., state, income, estate, local, sales, and property taxes) as well as differences in the cost of living. If you plan to stay put, you'll want to consider how your home equity factors into your plans.

**What do you want to do?**
The early stages of retirement can be an expensive time. Many people overestimate how much they'll be able to work in retirement, and underestimate how much they'll spend. Take a hard, realistic look at both fronts.

**How will you pay for health care?**
After food, health care is likely to be your second largest expense in retirement. According to the Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate,<sup>1</sup> an average retired couple age 65 in 2019 may need approximately $285,000 saved (after tax) to cover health care expenses in retirement.

While many preretirees are thinking ahead and factoring health care costs into their retirement savings plan, almost 4 in 10 are not.<sup>2</sup> In fact, 48% of preretirees estimated that their individual health care costs in retirement would be less than $100,000—far lower than Fidelity's current estimates.

If you've relied on your employer to pick up most of your health care tab, retirement could be a rude awakening: Only 18% of large companies offer health care benefits to retirees, according to a 2018 employer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Although Medicare kicks in at age 65, you may need to buy supplemental insurance or, at the very least, budget for higher out-of-pocket health care expenses than you had while you were working.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [How to plan for rising health care costs](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/plan-for-rising-health-care-costs) 2. Will you have enough? This is the most important question that many preretirees need to answer. According to Fidelity Investments' latest Retirement Savings Assessment (RSA),<sup>2</sup> the median baby boomer is on track to meet 86% of estimated retirement expenses: enough to cover the basics, but not sufficient to cover all estimated discretionary expenses.

With 5 years to go, you'll want to run some real numbers, either with help from an advisor or our [Fidelity Planning & Guidance Center](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/calculators-tools/planning-guidance-center). If the numbers aren't encouraging, you may need to rethink your plans, step up your savings, or both. The good news: If you're age 50 or older, you may be able to make up for a savings shortfall with additional catch-up contributions to your 401(k) or IRA. If you are age 55 or older, you can also make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution annually to your health savings account.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [How much do I need to retire?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire)

""Consider an annual savings goal of at least 15% or more (including any employer match), including 401(k) and other workplace plans, IRAs, and other savings,"" says Steven Feinschreiber, senior vice president at Fidelity. ""But that's only a rough guideline, and assumes continuous savings for 40 years of work and an age-appropriate asset mix.""

For baby boomers who are nearing retirement, saving more and adjusting their asset mix has less impact for the simple reason that they have less time for those changes to impact accumulated wealth—though it may still help. For them, postponing retirement is generally the most effective step. Delaying retirement from 65—the average age people planned to retire, [according to the RSA study](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/how-to-save-more-for-retirement-score)—to their full Social Security retirement age (between 66 and 67, depending on their birth year) may be the best way for most preretirees to boost their retirement savings and increase their retirement income levels. If you delay claiming, you’ll have more time to build your retirement nest egg and a shorter retirement to fund. 3. Are you invested properly? As you round the bend toward retirement, it’s not a good idea to take on any more investment risk than necessary for your time frame, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance. But remember that this does not mean the answer is always to become more conservative. The consequences of being too conservative can be just as worrisome when you account for inflation and the possibility that you could outlive your savings. That is why it is important to think about an appropriate asset allocation.

Although you can't control market behavior, you can help manage its long-term effect on your portfolio through investment choices and by modifying portfolios so they have an age-appropriate mix. According to the RSA survey, in 2018, 58% of all respondents had allocated their assets in a manner Fidelity considers age appropriate,<sup>2</sup> compared to 56% in 2013.

An ideal investment mix will depend on a number of factors, including your age, time horizon, financial situation, and risk tolerance. ""Retirement is often the time to take some risks off the table,"" notes Hevert, ""but some people are tempted to become too conservative. But don't forget that your goal is for your retirement savings to last for a 30-plus-year retirement time horizon. This usually means some longer-term growth potential is needed in the portfolio."" A financial advisor can help you rebalance your portfolio to get the appropriately diversified asset mix to help you meet your needs.

At the same time you think about shoring up your retirement nest egg, you need to begin thinking about how you'll convert some of these savings into retirement income. For many people, it's helpful to start by grouping potential sources of income into 2 basic buckets: guaranteed income from sources such as Social Security, pensions, and annuities, and variable income from a job, retirement savings, and other sources such as rental real estate.

Next, estimate your retirement expenses and then map out ways to meet essential expenses with guaranteed income sources, and discretionary expenses with nonguaranteed income. If you plan to work a bit during retirement, that may provide a conservative boost to your retirement income. But be cautious here. Survey data shows that many people are not able to work as long as they wanted. Finally, before you rush out to file for your Social Security benefits at age 62, consider the big picture: Generally, the longer you wait, the higher the potential lifetime benefits.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Should you take Social Security at 62?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/social-security-at-62)

After your review your current investment mix, you may also want to consider shifting a portion of your investment portfolio into income-producing assets, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks. A guaranteed income annuity<sup>3</sup> is another option to consider if you're interested in converting your assets to income. Generally, the older you are when you buy an annuity, the higher the monthly payout, but there may be advantages to purchasing an annuity before you reach retirement age. But these potential moves should still be done within the context of maintaining an appropriate overall asset mix across stocks, bonds, and cash. Remember, your retirement income will likely need to last for 30 years or more, which typically requires some exposure to stocks.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Create income that can last a lifetime](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/income-that-can-last-lifetime) 5. How does your home factor into your retirement? Your home is likely one of your most valuables assets. If either downsizing or relocating is in your plans, you may want to start plotting the move now. If moving isn't in the cards, you may still want to think through whether it makes sense to pay down your mortgage faster—thereby saving on interest payments and improving cash flow in retirement.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Should you move in retirement?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/relocate-in-retirement)

Alternatively, consider how to use some of your home equity to help finance your retirement. If tapping home equity is only a temporary solution to bridge the gap until you start to draw down your retirement assets or start receiving guaranteed income payments, consider applying for a home equity line of credit while you're still employed and more likely to qualify for the best rates. If home equity factors into your long-term planning, you could also consider a reverse mortgage. But proceed with care and be sure you understand all the associated costs and requirements. Before considering any of these ideas, make sure you consult a tax professional or attorney. Get started Between your investment portfolio, your home, and your lifestyle plans, there's a lot to cover between now and your retirement. Moreover, you'll likely revisit these topics several times over the next several years, as you well should. The point isn't to have all the answers right away, but to start preparing for the big decisions you'll soon face."

 *  For every year you delay past your FRA up to age 70, you get an 8% increase in your benefit. So, if you can afford it, waiting could be the better option.
 *  Health status, longevity, and retirement lifestyle are 3 variables that can play a role in your decision on when to claim your Social Security benefits. When it comes to Social Security, it can be tempting to take the money and run as soon as you're eligible—typically at age 62. After all, you've likely been paying into the system for all of your working life, and you're ready to receive your benefits. Plus, guaranteed monthly income is nice to have.

Health status, longevity, and retirement lifestyle are 3 key factors that can play a role in your decision on when to claim your Social Security benefits. You may not be able to predict the true impact of these variables, but you can rely on the simple fact that if you claim early versus later, you will likely have lower benefits from Social Security to help fund your retirement over the next 20–30+ years.

If you start taking Social Security at age 62, rather than waiting until your full retirement age (FRA), you can expect up to a 30% reduction in monthly benefits with lesser reductions as you approach FRA. Remember, FRA is no longer age 65. It now ranges from 66 to 67, depending on your date of birth (see your [full retirement age](http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/retirechart.htm)). And your annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is based on your benefit. So if you begin Social Security at 62, and start with reduced benefits, your COLA-adjusted benefit will be lower too.

Waiting to claim your Social Security benefit will result in a higher benefit. For every year you delay past your FRA, you get an 8% increase in your benefit. That could be at least a 24% higher monthly benefit if you delay claiming until age 70. But, make sure to evaluate your decision based on how much you've saved for retirement, your other sources of income in retirement, and your expectations for longevity.

While many people could benefit from waiting to age 70 to take Social Security payments, others may need this source of guaranteed income sooner to help pay their bills, or may anticipate that they may not live long enough to reap the rewards of delaying. The downside of claiming early: Reduced benefits Consider the following hypothetical example. Colleen is 62 as of 2019. If Colleen waits until age 66 and 6 months (her FRA) to collect, she will receive approximately $2,000 a month. However, if she begins taking benefits at age 62, she'll only receive $1,450 a month. This ""early retirement"" penalty is permanent and results in her receiving up to 28% less year after year.

However, if Colleen waits until age 70, her monthly benefits will increase another 28% over what she would receive at her FRA, to a total of $2,560 per month.<sup>1</sup> If she were to live to age 89, her lifetime benefits would be about $114,000 more, or at least 24% greater, because she had waited until age 70 to collect Social Security benefits.<sup>2</sup> (Note: All figures are in today's dollars and before tax; the actual benefit would be adjusted for inflation and would possibly be subject to income tax.) Spouses and Social Security Several Social Security claiming strategies were eliminated in 2015 including the ability to file a ""restricted application for spousal benefits,"" which allowed you to claim benefits based on your spouse's work record and then switch to claiming on your own work record at a later date. This strategy is no longer possible if you turned age 62 after December 31, 2015.

Claiming before your FRA on a spouse's record means you'll lose even more than claiming on your own record—the benefit reduction for a spouse is up to 35% while the reduction for claiming your own benefit is up to 30%. For instance, if you're the spouse of Colleen in the above example and you are the same age, you'd be eligible for only $675 a month at age 62, 33% less than the $1000 a month you would get at your FRA of 66 and 6 months.

Your decision to take benefits early could outlive you. If you were to die before your spouse, they would be eligible to receive your monthly amount as a survivor benefit—if it's higher than their own amount. But if you take your benefits early, say at age 62 versus waiting until age 70, your spouse's survivor Social Security benefit could be up to 30% less for the remainder of their lifetime. Bridge to Medicare Remember that while you are eligible for reduced Social Security benefits at 62, you won't be eligible for Medicare until age 65, so you will probably have to pay for private health insurance in the meantime. That can eat up a large chunk of your Social Security payments. For the average 55- to 64-year-old, total health care spending was $10,137 in 2016 (including $1,310 in out-of-pocket spending ).<sup>3</sup> Taking Social Security early to pay for temporary health care cost locks in a permanent Social Security reduction.

If you leave a job with good pay and benefits, it may be difficult ever to regain that level of compensation if you need or want to return to work later. Of course, not everyone can keep working, but it is something to consider if you are healthy and have the opportunity to stay in the workforce, in either a full-time or part-time capacity.

**Tip:** Women often live longer than men, and are more likely to depend on one income when they are older. Don’t make the mistake of coupling your decision to leave the workforce with your Social Security claiming strategy. Remember, by the time you get into your 80s, you have fewer financial options, so don't jump at the first opportunity to claim Social Security at age 62 just because you may want to quit your current job.

But there's even more to the story. As you approach retirement, you're often at the upper-end of your lifetime earnings trajectory—and of your ability to save more for retirement. In addition, if you can keep working, you can make ""catch-up"" contributions to a tax-deferred workplace savings plan like a 401(k) or 403(b) or a traditional or Roth IRA. Catch-up contributions allow you to set aside larger amounts of money for retirement.

Remember, if you decide to stop working at 62, you will cease tax-advantaged saving opportunities and cap your Social Security benefits throughout your retirement—and you may need to begin to draw down your savings earlier than you want.

When you factor in longevity, health care, and the cost of your expected lifestyle in retirement, your decision on whether or not to claim Social Security at age 62 may become clearer.

 *  They can provide guaranteed income for life.
 *  Also, lifetime annuities can help diversify your income sources.

The face of retirement in America has changed radically in recent decades. People are living longer. Pensions are increasingly rare. Add in market volatility, as well as questions surrounding the long-term financial health of Social Security, and it's no wonder many people feel anxious about funding their retirement.

If you were a newly hired employee at a Fortune 500 company in 1998, you had a 59% chance of having access to a pension plan. But, by 2017, only 16% of employees did. Over that same 19-year stretch, 42% of Fortune 500 employers froze their primary pension plan and 24% closed pension plans to new hires.<sup>1</sup> Today, the responsibility of financing your retirement is likely to fall squarely on your shoulders.

But there is a way to create a plan that can give you a regular ""retirement paycheck""—through a *lifetime income* annuity. Resembling a traditional pension plan,<sup>2</sup> this investment vehicle can provide a guaranteed<sup>3</sup> stream of income that lasts a lifetime and is not vulnerable to the inevitable ups and downs of the market.<sup>4</sup>

An added benefit is that by locking in some guaranteed income, you will have more freedom to invest the remainder of your retirement assets for growth potential as part of a diversified income plan. Investors might want to consider an income annuity to cover the portion of their essential expenses not covered by other guaranteed income sources like Social Security or a pension.

""What people may not realize is, once you have your essential expenses covered by guaranteed lifetime income, you gain peace of mind and the freedom to pursue the things you love in life,"" observes Tom Ewanich, vice president and actuary at Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company. ""Additionally, you may invest your remaining assets for growth, rather than worrying about how to preserve and stretch your portfolio for the rest of your life.""

A lifetime income annuity represents a contract with an insurance company that allows you to convert a portion of your retirement savings (an amount you choose) into a predictable lifetime income stream. In return for a lump-sum investment, the insurance company guarantees to pay you (or you and your spouse) a set amount of income for life. You also have the option of starting your income either immediately or at a date you select in the future.

Because an annuity's guarantees are only as strong as the insurance company providing them, you should consider the strength of the company you select and its ability to meet its future income obligations.

Having the backing of an insurance company can help mitigate 3 key retirement risks that, generally, can be very challenging to manage by yourself:

 *  **Market risk** – Regardless of whether the market goes up or down, the insurance company is obligated to provide you with income payments every year.
 *  **Longevity risk** – Rather than trying to figure out how much of your savings you can spend each year before running out of money, the insurance company assumes the responsibility for paying you as long as you live.
 *  **Inflation risk –** By including an annual increase option, where available, you can reduce the risk that inflation will diminish your purchasing power over time.

But not all lifetime income annuities are alike—some might provide higher levels of income with little or no flexibility in accessing assets, while others may provide lower levels of income with greater flexibility.

So you'll want to take the time to understand the differences among them and figure out which features might best meet your particular needs. Let's take a closer look at 2 categories of lifetime income annuities, namely, a fixed lifetime income annuity and a fixed annuity with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits. What is a fixed lifetime income annuity? As part of a diversified income plan, a fixed lifetime income annuity can provide you with guaranteed income for the rest of your life with payments starting immediately or at a future date that you select when you purchase the annuity.

These annuities offer:

 *  **Lifetime Income –** Avoid outliving your assets by ensuring you will receive a guaranteed stream of income beginning on a date you choose, up to 40 years from your time of purchase. You will also have the security of steady payments regardless of market fluctuations and downturns.
 *  **Personalization –** You may choose to receive guaranteed income for your lifetime (or for the lives of you and another person for joint accounts). In addition, you have the choice to purchase optional features to include protection for your beneficiaries or add an annual payment increase feature to help your payment keep pace with inflation.

The trade-off with an income annuity is that you typically must give up control of the portion of the savings you use to purchase one. In exchange, you don't have to manage your account to generate income, and you can secure a predictable income that lasts the rest of your life. However, be sure to ask your financial advisor about withdrawal features that are available on some income annuities, which may alleviate liquidity concerns. What's more, fixed lifetime income annuities are often able to provide higher income payments than other products, such as bonds, CDs, or money market funds, due to the ""longevity bonus"" they can provide (see the chart below). While the payments from traditional income solutions are limited to return of principal and interest from an investment, fixed lifetime income annuities also make available the ability to share in the longevity benefits of a ""mortality pool."" Effectively, assets from annuitants with a shorter life span remain in the mortality pool to support the payouts collected by those with a longer life span. Put simply, the longer you live, the more money you will receive. What are the payment options and features? Fixed lifetime income annuities offer various options that pay different amounts of income, based on the types of guarantees they provide. The 3 most common payment options are:

1.  **Life with a cash refund –** With this option, the priority is ensuring that you never get back less in payments than your original investment. As with many income annuities, you get a lifetime income payment (but typically lower than a life-only option). If you pass away before receiving payments that total your original investment, the remaining value will be paid to your beneficiaries. This means, for example, that if you purchase an annuity for $100,000 and are paid only $10,000 of income during your lifetime, the remaining $90,000 is paid to your heirs.
2.  **Life with a guarantee period –** You'll receive income payments for your lifetime. However, if you pass away before the guarantee period ends, any remaining income payments will continue to your beneficiaries until the end of the guarantee period. Here, you get a somewhat lower payment than life only, because the insurance company is guaranteeing to make payments for a minimum number of years.
3.  **Life only –** You'll receive income payments over your lifetime. The life-only option offers the highest possible income payment because it's only for as long as you live; no money goes to your heirs. This option typically works well for those in good health and who anticipate a long life.

In addition to different payment options, annuities can include different features. One example is an annual increase option. This feature is based on a fixed percentage and provides for annual increases in the payment amount beginning on the anniversary following your initial payment. Note that the initial payment amount for an annuity with this option may be lower than an identical annuity without the option.

Let's take a look at how these payment options might differ, using [Fidelity's Guaranteed Income Estimator tool](https://gpi.fidelity.com/ftgw/interfaces/gie). Shown below are the results for a hypothetical 65-year-old man who invests $100,000 in a lifetime income annuity starting today. We assume that he was born on November 1, 1954, and started receiving income on January 9, 2020. What's right for you? Choosing a payment option means focusing on the specific features of a fixed lifetime income annuity and your personal goals. ""Consider what's most important to you regarding your retirement plans. Do you need the most guaranteed income available, or are you willing to accept a slightly lower payment to help provide additional protection for your beneficiaries?"" says Ewanich. What is a fixed annuity with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit? As part of a diversified income plan, a fixed deferred annuity with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) can provide guaranteed income for the rest of your life, starting on a date you select when you’re ready to start receiving income.

These annuities offer:

 *  **Lifetime income –** Avoid outliving your assets by guaranteeing a lifetime withdrawal benefit amount, beginning on a date you select.
 *  **Flexibility –** You choose when you would like to start receiving income, but if your situation changes and you need some or all of your money sooner, you have access to any accumulation value in your contract.<sup>5</sup>

From the time of purchase, you will know how much income you are guaranteed (or you and your spouse for joint contracts) at any age you decide to start lifetime withdrawals. Most importantly, you will have the security of a guaranteed cash flow, regardless of market fluctuations and downturns. Finally, in the event of your death, your beneficiaries will receive any remaining balance in your policy. How do lifetime income annuities fit into a retirement portfolio? A lifetime income annuity can help diversify your retirement income portfolio so a portion of your income is shielded from market volatility. Generally, Fidelity believes that assets allocated to annuities should represent not more than 50% of your liquid net assets. Why? Well, even though these products provide guaranteed income for life, they may also require that you give up some liquidity and access to that part of your portfolio.

Ultimately, your overall portfolio may benefit from a lifetime income annuity to help meet essential expenses throughout your retirement."

| Balance cash flow and liquidity. Holding too much cash may mean you miss out on investing opportunities. But make sure to have enough liquid assets to cover ongoing expenses.  Consider a bucket approach to manage cash for different shorter- and longer-term needs.  Take advantage of web-based and smartphone technology to manage day-to-day financial transactions easily from anywhere. |  | Whatever the size of your nest egg, retirement will likely mean big changes in your financial life. Sources of income can shift, as can expenses. Financial priorities often change as well as you move from saving for retirement to generating income from your hard-earned retirement savings.

""For many retirees, having a cash cushion can help provide peace of mind,"" says Klara Iskoz, vice president of Fidelity Financial Solutions. ""Although they have the ability to take distributions from their 401(k)s or IRAs, many people don't want to sell off invested assets to pay for unexpected expenses."" Balancing act: cash flow vs. liquidity When it comes to managing cash flow in retirement, there are 2 key concepts to understand: cash flow and liquidity.

**Cash flow** simply means the amount of cash you have coming in and going out each month (see chart below). Think about it as mapping your income versus your expenses. If you anticipate risk factors that can often come with retirement (health care expense, a downturn in the market, or a family emergency) then consider increasing your position in cash (or cash equivalents like Treasury bills, CDs, and money market accounts).

**Liquidity** refers to the ease of turning an asset to cash—and how quickly you can access that cash. The easier an asset can be converted to cash, the more ""liquid"" it is. For example, your cash holdings in your brokerage account are more liquid than your house. Similarly, you can sell shares in a mutual fund to pay for expenses. However, you can't immediately convert certain insurance policies into cash (without generally paying penalties or surrender fees) or quickly sell valuables such as art or coin collections.

Like many challenges in retirement, this is also a balancing act. If you have too much money in cash, you can be missing out on potential growth. At the same time, you'll want to consider which assets will be available to you over the next few years to help pay ongoing expenses in retirement. Managing your retirement income To start, consider the ways that retirement can change cash flow. Your weekly or biweekly paycheck may be replaced by income from a variety of sources, including Social Security benefits, pension distributions, and annuity payments. If you are age 72<sup>1</sup> or older, the IRS mandates that you take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your retirement accounts. Some retirees may also generate income from part-time employment, real estate rental income, or sales of assets.

To help manage a variety of income sources efficiently, you can set up direct deposit services, or use a financial institution that offers remote deposit—meaning you can log on to your computer or smartphone and scan or snap a photo of a check.

Spending patterns will also likely change, reflecting both your new lifestyle and shifting financial responsibilities. When you retire, often nothing is being withheld for state and federal income taxes, so you may be responsible for any quarterly estimated taxes. Likewise, most retirees generally have to pay health care and other insurance premiums directly to the insurance carrier(s). Some retirees may also find they are traveling more or living in dual residences. All these situations can make monthly bill paying even more complicated.

**Tip:** Learn how to take advantage of web-based and smartphone technology that makes it easy to effectively manage your day-to-day financial transactions from anywhere. Doing so can eliminate worries about paying the mortgage bill, no matter where you happen to be. Consider a bucket approach to managing cash At any point in your retirement, your income streams may be producing more cash than you are spending. If so, you'll want to think about how to continue to invest that excess cash flow to help meet both your near-term liquidity needs and longer-term needs for both income and growth. When investing, be sure to make liquidity—how quickly you need access to your cash—a central consideration.

One approach to consider is to bucket cash for different shorter- and longer-term needs, such as living expenses, short-term goals, and emergencies. Here are some ways to implement each: Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Budgeting for retirees](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/budgeting-in-retirement) Managing cash when you take your RMDs For many retirees, estimating and taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) once you reach age 72<sup><font>2</font></sup> plays a big role in managing cash in retirement. ""If you're planning to spend your RMDs to cover your ongoing retirement expenses,"" says Iskoz, ""you may want to consider having the money sent directly to a cash management or bank account that provides helpful cash management tools.""

RMD distributions can also be a time to rebalance your asset allocation. For example, as you get older, you'll likely want to sell off higher risk investments and take proceeds from RMDs (after you pay your taxes) and put them into more conservative investment options.

You have until December 31 each year to take your RMD.\* You can opt to take one-time distributions for your RMDs year after year, but the easiest way to satisfy your RMD is by setting up automatic withdrawals and potentially avoid paying penalties if you forget to take your RMD.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Smart strategies for required distributions](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/smart-ira-withdrawal-strategies) Look for flexibility and convenience in a cash management account The key to managing cash in your retirement is to make sure your money can be easily accessed, moved, and invested according to your needs, and, ideally, to do so in a way that mitigates overall fees. Look for a provider that offers options to easily transfer money from your retirement accounts, such as IRAs, into your cash account.

Some firms offer periodic withdrawals to help you create a ""just-in-time"" income stream and allow remaining assets to produce potential earnings until you need more cash. If you are spending less than you expected, consider setting up access to a sweep system that automatically reinvests excess cash.

It's important to choose reliable financial institutions that provide the features you need to make your retirement finances easy to manage, affordable, and flexible. Consider an account that offers:

 *  Mobile deposit
 *  Online access
 *  Free checks
 *  The ability to speak with a representative by phone or in person
 *  The option for a spouse or authorized person to act on your behalf
 *  The ability to link accounts across different banks and brokerage firms

**Tip:** If FDIC coverage is important to you, make sure that your cash accounts don't exceed the maximum covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures individual bank accounts for up to $250,000 per institution. A clear picture helps you keep tabs on your finances throughout retirement Finally, the retirement cash management system you create with your providers should offer a comprehensive view of your finances. Being able to access concise, up-to-date reports on your cash balances, transactions, and assets is a basic requirement and can help prevent unpleasant cash flow surprises.

Now that you’re retired, take advantage of ways to streamline how you manage cash and pay bills. Your cash needs will change over the course of your retirement, so working with your Fidelity advisor to think through the ""what ifs"" of future cash management also means making decisions about how to use your financial resources during a retirement that may stretch 30 years or more."

Choosing the appropriate people to fulfill the key roles in your estate plan is a critical task.
 *  Consider important factors such as your future health care and living expenses, philanthropy, and desires to make educational gifts to family members as part of your wealth transfer decisions.
 *  Review your plan as circumstances change. As a general rule, you should have your estate planning documents reviewed every 3 to 5 years. Money is one subject that families are often reluctant to talk about. Death is another. Combine them—as in talking about your estate plan—and avoidance is a common reaction.

Nonetheless, talking with family members about plans to protect and transfer assets can help avoid unwelcome surprises and unnecessary stress after you or your spouse dies. Talking about money and values can also strengthen family ties and develop a shared purpose while you are still alive and able to enjoy the results.

Of course, deciding how and when to bring family into your estate planning process is a very personal and sometimes difficult decision. ""Consider easing into the discussion with a topic that resonates more easily, such as charity,"" says David Peterson, head of wealth planning at Fidelity. ""Discuss your vision for your family, your children, and your wealth, and the impact you want to have on society. The more you can get everyone feeling engaged and empowered, the better these conversations will go.""

Before you start the process of giving away money—or “wealth transfer” as it's sometimes known—make sure your financial plan accounts for expected health care costs, taxes, and all other living expenses for the rest of your life. You may also want to develop a real estate strategy that maps out where you plan to live in 5, 10, or even 25 years. Once those elements are in place, you can kick‐start your estate planning process with our 4‐step wealth transfer and asset protection guide. 1. Pinpoint your family vision  *  **Start by creating a family tree.** The evaluation of wealth transfer objectives and of wealth transfer strategies will benefit from the involvement of an estate planning attorney. To best explore all the options for building your specific plan, your attorney will need to know all the players in your family—or families—and how they may factor into your intentions.
 *  **Understand your wealth transfer objectives.** Consider who you wish to receive a portion of your assets, and when. Then, put together a list of objectives, covering such topics as:

 *  **Wealth transfer:** How can you help ensure that your assets will be transferred smoothly to your heirs? Beyond having a will and estate plan, you may want to set up trusts.
 *  **Philanthropy:** What causes are most important to you and your family? How do you want to support them?
 *  **Living expenses:** Do you want to provide financial assistance to family members, such as your parents, children, or grandchildren, or to relatives who require special care?
 *  **Education:** Do you want to contribute to your children's or grandchildren's education? Contributions to 529 college savings plans or direct tuition payments to an institution can lower your taxable estate.
 *  **Incapacitation:** Who do you want to make key decisions to help protect your family if you're unable to make your wishes known?

**Tip:** Talk with your family about the importance of incapacity planning before a loved one becomes incapacitated. Without the proper—or properly updated—documents (durable power of attorney, health care directive), a spouse or family member may not have the legal authority to manage financial matters on behalf of the incapacitated person. 2. Identify your assets and liabilities When planning for your family's financial future, be comprehensive. Start out by creating a personal balance sheet.

 *  **Catalogue all your assets, their location, and their value:** Financial accounts (including retirement accounts), share certificates or investments not located in financial accounts, real estate, business interests, safe-deposit boxes, tangible personal property, mineral rights, life insurance, mortgages or notes owed to you, and any other assets (trusts, investment interests, etc.).
 *  **List all your liabilities:** Mortgages, secured debt (e.g., car loans) and unsecured debt (e.g., credit cards). Be sure to include shared obligations and those you have guaranteed, such as a student loan or mortgage for a child or grandchild.
 *  **Record ownership/titling** for each asset and liability.
 *  **Review beneficiary designations** for relevant assets to ensure they are consistent with your overall wishes and they coordinate with your other estate planning documents. 3. Focus on your legal documentation Before you meet with an estate planning attorney, you will need to pull together key documents.

 *  **Start by getting copies of beneficiary designations** for all your accounts, including insurance policies; annuities; and saving, brokerage, and retirement plan accounts.
 *  **Next, learn about the 2 common documents found in an estate plan:**

 *  **A will** is an essential legal document that sets forth your wishes regarding the distribution of your property and the care of any minor children when you die.
 *  **A trust** is a more complex legal structure that contains a set of instructions on exactly how and when to pass assets to trust beneficiaries. Trusts are a tool that can allow you to control when and to whom your assets will be distributed. For more on trusts, read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [6 reasons you should consider a trust](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/reasons-to-consider-a-trust).

 *  **Then consider additional supporting documents** intended to protect you and provide instructions in the event of your incapacity. Among them:

 *  **A power of attorney** appoints an agent to act on your behalf regarding financial and other matters while you are alive.
 *  **A health care proxy** names the agent who can make health care decisions for you if you are unable to communicate for yourself.
 *  **A HIPAA release** informs doctors and other hospital staff of people who can visit you and the information they can receive if you are unable to state your wishes directly. Without a properly executed HIPAA release, your named agents may not have the ability to talk with your doctors or access your medical records.
 *  **An organ donation form** enables you to state your desire to have all or part of your body donated for transplant or medical research.
 *  **A living will or medical directive** outlines your wishes regarding life‐prolonging medical treatments, and may vary depending on your state of residence.
 *  **A final wishes letter of intent** is not a legal document but can be a catchall for anything you want to document, including the type of service, burial, or cremation you want.
 *  **A letter of instruction** usually contains the critical information your family will need in the event of your incapacitation or death, including a contact list of your advisors, a current inventory of your assets, a list of legal documents, and instructions on where to find important information.

 *  **Determine key roles.** Choosing and documenting the appropriate people to fulfill the following key roles in your estate plan is a critical task for you and your family. It is also important to make sure the people you designate are comfortable taking on these roles and that you consider successors for each of them:

 *  **Personal representative/executor** will work with your attorney—and potentially the court system—to ensure the collection and disposition of your assets to the appropriate people in accordance with your wishes.
 *  **Trustee** is the individual or professional corporate trustee who will hold the trust assets on behalf of the trust beneficiaries. The trustee has the fiduciary obligation to make sure trust assets are properly invested and distributed according to the instructions in your trust.
 *  **Guardian** is the individual who is legally responsible for the personal and property interests of your minor children. Note: The parties you designate to care for your children do not have to be the same parties who manage their assets.

 *  **Meet with your attorney.** Typically, your first meeting offers the opportunity for the attorney to describe their estate planning process and review any documents you bring to the meeting. Your attorney should also discuss their fees, tell you how long it will take to draft your plan's documents, and answer any questions you or your family may have.
    
    Once you have chosen an attorney, the process usually has 3 phases:

 *  **Draft and execute your documents:** At this stage, generally your attorney will draft and review all your new estate planning documents with you and have you sign them. Depending on your state of residence, there may be specific requirements as to the form or content of these documents or the manner of execution. For example, some states require that signatures be witnessed or notarized if your family's needs or plans change, so you'll want to ensure that you can amend your documents.
 *  **Implement your estate plan:** After you have signed your documents, your attorney can help you with the follow‐up steps required to complete your estate plan. These may involve retitling assets between you and your spouse, completing or amending beneficiary designations, and retitling assets in the name of a trust.
 *  **Store your documents in a safe place:** You can either store your estate plan and other important documents in your attorney's office or select a fireproof place—such as a bank safe-deposit box—that someone close to you can access in an emergency. Many families today use secure virtual safes such as [FidSafe<sup>®*</sup>](https://www.fidsafe.com/?utm_source=fid.com&utm_medium=vp&utm_campaign=jan16-allinonewealthtransferchecklist) to store copies of important documents and other information, such as passwords, financial statements, and wills.

**Tip:** If you plan to store your documents in a bank safe-deposit box, be sure family members, successor trustees, or named agents will be able to access the safe-deposit box upon your incapacity or demise. Otherwise, your family may need to obtain court approval to gain access. 4. Follow up on your plan Once you have your plan in place, you should continue the vital discussions you've already started with your family members regarding the details of your plan. Sharing the particulars of your plan is a highly personal decision. But helping your loved ones better understand your intentions before any incapacitation or death is something to carefully consider.

Finally, review your plan as circumstances change. As a general rule, you should have the estate planning documents reviewed every 3 to 5 years. In addition, you should review your plan when major life events occur, such as marriage, the birth of a child, divorce, the receipt of an inheritance, or a death."

Trying to make sense of these different products doesn't have to be overwhelming. Here is what to expect, and some factors to consider as you weigh your investment objectives. A brief history of funds and ETFs For decades, investors have turned to traditional actively managed, open-ended mutual funds for an easy-to-use product to help them meet their financial goals and offer the potential to outperform a benchmark (often a widely followed index).

In the early 1990s, the set of investment vehicles available to investors expanded with the creation of ETFs. ETFs give investors pricing during the day and more discretion over the timing of their trades. Like stocks, ETFs allow investors to choose their market entry and exit points throughout the trading day. In 2008, actively managed ETFs came on the scene. In these vehicles, a portfolio manager attempts to outperform an index, versus just replicating an index's performance.

From an investor's perspective, these actively managed ETFs offer a way to combine the potential advantages of active management with the trading flexibility of exchange-traded products. Different products, different experiences As you consider ETFs and open-ended mutual funds, it is important to recognize how the vehicles' similarities and differences may influence your investing experience. Buying and selling, pricing, disclosure, costs, holding-period return, and tax implications can all be different (see the table below).

For example, unlike with a traditional open-ended mutual fund, the price of an ETF is set throughout the day. Higher demand from investors can result in the shares trading at a premium (compared to the value of the stocks that the ETF holds), and falling demand could cause the ETF to trade at a discount (compared to the value of the ETF's holdings). This continuous pricing and the ability to place [limit orders](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/stop-loss-video) means the ETF's performance for any given time period is based largely on the market price return during the holding period, rather than on the ETF's net asset value (NAV)—the value of the stocks held by the ETF. |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|

Typically, the best way for an investor to choose an investment is to use their own goals, financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline to create a strategy. Using that perspective may help to identify appropriate investment vehicles. Consider the following types of investors and their varied objectives. Active investor Fidelity believes in taking a long-term view of investing. But some people choose to be more active, accepting the risk and costs of buying and selling securities more frequently. If you prefer to manage your own accounts and want to trade during market hours to implement your preferred investment strategies, ETFs can offer the flexibility to meet your needs. Similar to stocks and other types of investments, ETFs can be traded throughout the trading day and on margin. Investors also have the ability to set limit orders and sell short. Most open-ended mutual funds can only be purchased at their closing prices, or NAVs. ETFs offer transparency, allowing investors to review holdings daily and monitor portfolio risk exposures more frequently than with traditional open-ended mutual funds.

For the active investor, ETFs may may satisfy the investor's need for more trading flexibility and holdings transparency. Long-term investor Consider investors weighing options for their long-term investment goals. Fidelity believes that short-term trading is generally not an appropriate savings strategy. With a long-term view, investors may not want to devote a lot of time to worrying about the intricacies of an active trading strategy; they might have little use for the potential of buying or selling shares during the day; and they would likely want to minimize transaction costs for regular purchases.

Many open-ended mutual funds are available with no loads, no commissions, and no transaction fees. Many brokerages and banks offer automatic investing plans that allow regular purchases of mutual funds. These programs generally do not exist for ETFs. Moreover, open-ended mutual funds are bought and sold at their NAV, so there are no premiums or discounts. While an ETF also has a daily NAV, shares may trade at a premium or discount on the exchange during the day.<sup>2</sup> Investors should evaluate the share price of an ETF relative to its indicative NAV.

Finally, any tax benefits that may exist for an ETF are irrelevant for someone saving in a tax-deferred IRA or workplace savings account, such as a 401(k), since taxes are paid upon withdrawal.

For the long-term investor, a traditional open-ended mutual fund could be an investor’s preferred option due to low transaction costs and automatic investing options. Investors in a high tax bracket Investors in a high tax bracket who are saving in a taxable account, like a brokerage account, may be interested in investments that offer tax efficiency for their taxable assets. In this scenario, if an investor finds that an open-ended index mutual fund and an index ETF are similar relative to their investment objectives, passive investments—index funds and passive ETFs—have the potential to be more tax-efficient than active funds and active ETFs.

Relative to actively managed mutual funds, some actively managed ETFs offer potential tax advantages.<sup>3</sup> However, we caution investors against making long-term investment decisions based solely on any potential tax benefits. Investors should evaluate how an investment option fits with their time horizons, financial circumstances, and tolerance for market volatility, as well as cost and other features.

Investors in a high tax bracket may choose ETFs to take advantage of potentially greater tax efficiency. Summary While mutual funds and ETFs are different, both can offer exposure to a diversified basket of securities, and can be good vehicles to help meet investor objectives. It is important for investors to pick the best choice for their specific investing needs, whether an ETF, an open-ended mutual fund, or a combination of both.

Here are some points to consider when weighing vehicle options:  *  **Trading**
    Is it important to be able to execute fund trades at prevailing prices throughout the trading day? Consider ETFs.
 *  **Transaction costs**
    Would you prefer trading a fund at NAV without paying a load, and avoiding the potential of paying a premium at purchase (discount at sale)? Consider ETFs or no-load mutual funds.
 *  **Margin**
    Do you like the flexibility of trading on margin? Consider ETFs.<sup>4</sup>
 *  **Automatic saving**
    Does your investment strategy include dollar-cost averaging? Consider the automated savings features of mutual funds in brokerage accounts.
 *  **Transparency**
    Do you want to know a fund’s holdings each day? Consider ETFs that offer holdings transparency.
 *  **Cost**
    Make sure to consider all costs and expenses related to any investment vehicle.
 *  **Diversification**
    Do the benefits of both ETFs and mutual funds have the potential to help meet investment goals? Consider building a portfolio incorporating both types of vehicles, including other types of investments, to gain exposure to different asset classes."

Though the contributions were made after-tax, earnings on after-tax contributions are treated as pre-tax money.
 *  To roll after-tax money to a Roth IRA, earnings on the after-tax balance must, in most cases, also be rolled out. Depending on the plan, it may be necessary to roll out any other pre-tax money too.
 *  Rolling pre-tax balances into a traditional IRA is not a taxable event. Any partial rollover of after-tax contributions and their earnings must be done in the same proportion to their levels in the workplace plan.
 *  Consult a tax advisor before making a decision, to make sure you’re not losing other potential tax advantages such as net unrealized appreciation for employer stock or early withdrawal exemptions. Workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s offer some tax benefits for your retirement savings. The tax benefit you receive depends on the type of contributions you make. It's important to understand the way your contributions are taxed so you can make informed decisions about what to do with your money.

There are 3 types of contributions a participant can make to a workplace retirement plan: pre-tax (or traditional) contributions, Roth contributions, and after-tax contributions.

 *  Elective deferrals are pre-tax contributions that are deducted from your salary before taxes are taken out. Employer contributions to the plan, such as matching funds and profit sharing, are also pre-tax contributions made to the plan. In retirement, withdrawals would be taxed as income.
 *  Roth contributions are also another form of elective deferrals that are made after taxes have been taken out of your pay. When Roth money is withdrawn from a plan in retirement, no taxes or penalties would be due as long as the withdrawals are qualified.
 *  The IRS also allows for after-tax employee contributions to a plan above the annual elective deferral contribution limit—which is $19,000 for 2019 and $19,500 for 2020—though not all employers offer the option to make after-tax contributions. In retirement, withdrawals of after-tax contributions would be tax-free, but any earnings on the after-tax contributions would be taxed as income. Taxes on earnings from after-tax contributions After-tax contributions to a 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan get a different tax treatment than their earnings. Since you've already paid taxes on the contributions, those withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. But the IRS considers the earnings to be pre-tax—so they would be treated as pre-tax and you would owe income tax when you take them out of the account.

Earnings in Roth IRAs, however, aren't subject to income tax as long as all withdrawals from the account are qualified withdrawals. So rolling after-tax money from a workplace plan to a Roth IRA means you can avoid taxes on any future earnings. Rolling over after-tax money to a Roth IRA If you have after-tax money in your traditional 401(k), 403(b), or other workplace retirement savings account, you can roll it over to a Roth IRA without paying taxes, as long as certain rules are met. (Note: Your plan's terms will determine when and how money is distributable. Please review your plan document or summary plan description for more information about disbursements from the plan.)

According to IRS guidance, you can roll after-tax money to a Roth IRA and pre-tax money to a traditional IRA and avoid creating taxable income. As with any decisions with potential tax implications, always consult a tax advisor to decide if it’s the right move for you. The IRS allows for a few different scenarios—but not all may be allowed by your plan.

In the most straightforward scenario, the entire account balance would be rolled out of the workplace plan, sending after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA and pre-tax contributions and earnings to a traditional IRA.

The IRS allows plan participants to take partial withdrawals, including those that are from a single source balance. The catch is that your plan is not obligated to permit partial distributions and also may not track the sources of each participant's balance.

If the plan allows partial withdrawals and does track each source balance separately, one could take a rollover of just the after-tax source balance, which includes both the after-tax contributions and all of the associated earnings. Again, the after-tax balance would go to a Roth IRA while earnings would go to a traditional IRA.

In that scenario, one could also choose to roll out only a portion of the after-tax balance. In that case, the rollover must be split proportionally between after-tax contributions and earnings relative to the levels of each in the plan.

Important note: Any partial withdrawals may affect eligibility for net unrealized appreciation treatment on appreciated employer stock held in the plan.

Contributions made before 1987 are treated differently than those made after 1987. Unlike post-1986 employee contributions, pre-1987 employee contributions may be distributed without taking a taxable disbursement of the associated earnings. If you have contributions from 1986 or before, consult your tax advisor for more information.

**Other potential benefits of rolling after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA**

**Investment choices.** A Roth IRA may provide more investment choices than are typically available in an employer's plan, although an employer's plan may also offer institutionally priced investments and/or customized plan options not available in an IRA.

**Required distributions.** There are no required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a Roth IRA during your lifetime. Once you reach age 72<sup>1</sup>, however, you will need to start taking distributions from a 401(k) including those contributions and earnings recordkept as Roth contributions to the plan, unless you are still working at the company.

Some employers offer a Roth 401(k) option and also allow participants to convert after-tax contributions into an in-plan Roth account, so check with your employer to see if it is an option. In some cases, it may make sense to roll over your after-tax contributions to a Roth inside your plan than outside.

**Flexibility.** Once the money is in a Roth IRA, you may have greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals before retirement. Unlike employer-sponsored retirement plans, Roth IRAs allow (within limits) for penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase or qualified education expenses like going to graduate school.<sup>2</sup> After certain requirements are met, converted balances within Roth IRAs may be withdrawn without taxes or penalties for other purposes as well. Finally, Roth IRAs are also not subject to various restrictions that plan sponsors sometimes place on workplace plans. Here’s how it works Let's look at 2 hypothetical examples of a 401(k) rollover to a Roth IRA.

In the first, let's assume Andrew is age 60, retired, and has $1 million in his 401(k): $800,000, or 80%, is pre-tax; and $200,000, or 20%, is after-tax contributions. We'll also assume that while Andrew’s plan does allow partial withdrawals, it does not track source balances separately. So while only part of the $800,000 in pre-tax balances is attributable to earnings on Andrew's after-tax contributions (the remainder being some combination of pre-tax contributions, earnings, and matching) the entire pre-tax balance, regardless of source, is treated as a single lump sum. Andrew wants to roll over $100,000 from his 401(k) to IRAs and leave the remainder where it is.

If he rolls over $80,000 to a traditional IRA and $20,000 to a Roth IRA, he will have no federal income tax liability. That's because the rollover to the traditional IRA is equal to the proportion (80%) of pre-tax money in the 401(k). The rollover of after-tax amounts to a Roth IRA are tax-free.

What if Andrew wanted to roll over $100,000 entirely into a Roth IRA? He could do that, but in this case, $80,000 would be considered a taxable Roth conversion, because 80% of his 401(k) balance is pre-tax money.

Now let's consider a second hypothetical example: Everything is the same except that we'll assume Andrew's plan *does* track source balances separately, so Andrew can withdraw just from his after-tax source balance. Also, let's assume that of the $800,000 in total pre-tax balances, $100,000 is earnings attributable to the after-tax contributions. Another way to look at it is that Andrew has made $200,000 in post-1986 after-tax contributions to the plan with $100,000 in pre-tax earnings attributable to the contributions.

Instead of considering the entire account, and treating the $100,000 withdrawal as 80% pre-tax and 20% after-tax, Andrew would make a withdrawal from the after-tax source balance only, and that would be 66.6% after-tax and 33.3% pre-tax. This is because the after-tax source balance is composed of $200,000 in after-tax contributions and $100,000 in earnings, for a total of $300,000, so the $200,000 in after-tax contributions represents two-thirds of the total and the earnings represent the remaining one-third.

When planning to roll over after-tax and pre-tax contributions, be sure to let the plan administrator know. That can help ensure that the distributions are reported to the IRS appropriately. Weigh all options Deciding whether to roll over your 401(k) isn't necessarily a straightforward decision. This is why we suggest that investors carefully assess their situation, consider all available options and the applicable fees and features of each before moving retirement assets, and check with a tax advisor to help make an informed decision."

Track your money using 3 categories.," Key takeaways  *  Consider allocating no more than 50% of take-home pay to essential expenses.
 *  Try to save 15% of pretax income (including employer contributions) for retirement.
 *  Save for the unexpected by keeping 5% of take-home pay in short-term savings for unplanned expenses. Budget. Does anyone like that word? How about this instead—the 50/15/5 rule? It’s our simple rule of thumb for saving and spending: Aim to allocate no more than 50% of take-home pay to essential expenses, save 15% of pretax income for retirement savings, and keep 5% of take-home pay for short-term savings. (Your situation may be different, but you can use our rule of thumb as a starting point.)

Why 50/15/5? We analyzed hundreds of scenarios in order to create a saving and spending guideline that can help people save enough to retire. Our research found that by sticking to this guideline, there is a good chance of maintaining financial stability now and keeping your current lifestyle in retirement. To see where you stand on our 50/15/5 rule, use our [Savings and spending check-up](https://communications.fidelity.com/wi/2015/savingsandspendingcheckup/). Essential expenses: 50% Some expenses simply aren’t optional—you need to eat and you need a place to live. Consider allocating no more than 50% of take-home pay to “must-have” expenses, such as:

 *  Housing—mortgage, rent, property tax, utilities (electricity, etc.), homeowners/renters insurance, and condo/home association fees
 *  Food—groceries only; do not include takeout or restaurant meals, unless you really consider them essential, i.e., you never cook and always eat out
 *  Health care—health insurance premiums (unless they are made via payroll deduction) and out-of-pocket expenses (e.g., prescriptions, co-payments)
 *  Transportation—car loan/lease, gas, car insurance, parking, tolls, maintenance, and commuter fares
 *  Child care—day care, tuition, and fees
 *  Debt payments and other obligations—credit card payments, student loan payments, child support, alimony, and life insurance

Keep it below 50%: Just because some expenses are essential doesn’t mean they’re not flexible. Small changes can add up, such as turning the heat down a few degrees in the winter (and turning your AC up a few degrees in the summer), buying—and stocking up on—groceries when they are on sale, and bringing lunch to work. Also consider driving a more affordable car, carpooling, or taking public transportation. Consider a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), with a [health savings account](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/hsa-healthy-habits) (HSA) to reduce health care costs and get a tax break. If you need to significantly reduce your living expenses, consider a less expensive home or apartment. There are many other ways you can save. Take a look at which essential expenses are most important, and which ones you may be able to cut back on. Retirement savings: 15% [![Savings and spending checkup](/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/PF/saving_spending_feb25_2015.jpg)](https://communications.fidelity.com/wi/2015/savingsandspendingcheckup/) It’s important to save for your future—no matter how young or old you are. Why? Pension plans are rare. Social Security probably won’t provide all the money a person needs to live the life they want in retirement. In fact, we estimate that about 45% of retirement income will need to come from savings. That’s why we suggest people consider saving 15% of pretax household income for retirement. That includes their contributions and any matching or profit sharing contributions from an employer. Starting early, saving consistently, and investing wisely is important, as is saving in tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as a 401(k)s, 403(b)s, or IRAs.

How to get to 15%: If contributing that amount right now is not possible, check to see if your employer has a program that automatically increases contributions annually until a goal is met. Another strategy is to start by contributing at least enough to meet an employer match, and then if you get a raise or annual bonus, add all or part of these funds to your workplace savings plan or individual retirement account until you have reached the annual contribution limit. Short-term savings: 5% Everyone can benefit from having an emergency fund. An emergency, like an illness or job loss, is bad enough, but not being prepared financially can only make things worse. A good rule of thumb is to have enough put aside in savings to cover 3 to 6 months of essential expenses. Think of emergency fund contributions as a regular bill every month, until there is enough built up.

While emergency funds are meant for more significant events, like job loss, we also suggest saving a percentage of your pay to cover smaller unplanned expenses. Who hasn't been invited to a wedding—or several? Cracked the screen on a smartphone? Gotten a flat tire? In addition to those there are certain category of expenses which are often overlooked, for example; maintenance and repairs of cars, field trips for kids, copay for doctor's visit, Christmas gifts, Halloween costumes to name a few. Setting aside 5% of monthly take-home pay can help with these ""one-off"" expenses. It's good practice to have some money set aside for the random expenses, this way you won't be tempted to tap into your emergency fund or tempted to pay for one of these things by adding to an existing credit card balance. Over time, these balances can be hard to pay off. However, if you pay the entire credit card balance every month, and get points or cash back for purchases, using a credit card for one-off expenses may make sense.

How to get to 5%: Having this money automatically taken out of a paycheck and deposited in a separate account just for short-term savings can help a person reach this goal. What next? Our guidelines are intended to serve as a starting point. It is important to evaluate your situation and adjust these guidelines as necessary. If you’re close to the 50/15/5 target spending and saving amounts, good job. And for those staying within the guidelines, any remaining income is theirs to save or spend as they would like. Some ideas: First, pay down high-interest debt. For other goals, like paying for a child’s college or wedding, you could use the remaining income to save for them. And, finally, for those who want to retire early, or haven’t been saving diligently, putting it toward retirement savings may make sense.

The good news is that it isn’t about micromanaging every penny. Analyzing current spending and saving based on our 3 categories can give you control—and confidence. Most everyone's financial situation will change over time. A new job, marriage, children, and other life events may change cash flow. It’s a good idea to revisit spending and saving regularly, particularly after any major life events."

 *  Trusts can help reduce estate taxes for married couples.
 *  Gain control over distribution of your assets by using trusts.
 *  With a trust, you can ensure that your retirement assets are distributed as you've planned.

If you haven't stopped to consider how a trust may help you pass your wishes and wealth on, you could be making a critical estate planning mistake. Especially for individuals with substantial assets, protecting wealth for future generations should be top of mind.

""People often fail to appreciate the power a trust can have as part of a well-crafted estate plan, but that can be a costly mistake,"" says Rodney Weaver, VP, Advanced Planning at Fidelity. ""Trusts are flexible and powerful tools that can be used to gain greater control over how they pass their wealth to future generations.""

**A trust** is a legal structure that contains a set of instructions on exactly how and when to pass assets to trust beneficiaries. There are many types of trusts to consider, each designed to help achieve a specific goal. An estate planning professional can help you determine which type (or types) of trusts are most appropriate for you. However, an understanding of the estate planning goals that a trust may help you achieve is a good starting point. Benefits of a trust An effective trust begins with documentation carefully drafted by a qualified attorney with knowledge of your specific situation as well as current laws. Without the appropriate documentation, you and your beneficiaries may not reap the benefits of a trust, some of which are described below. 1. Pass wealth efficiently and privately to your heirs Perhaps the most powerful and straightforward way to use a trust is to ensure that your heirs have timely access to your wealth. When you transfer your assets to your beneficiaries through a will, your estate is settled through a procedure known as ""probate,"" which is conducted in state courts. However, probate is a public, legal process that can carry with it some unforeseen negative consequences for the administration of your estate, including:

 *  **Delays.** Probate proceedings can take time, some may take longer than a year. Additionally, if you own property located in states other than your home state; probate may be required in each such state.
 *  **Costs.** Probate fees can be quite substantial, even for the most basic case with no conflict between beneficiaries. A rule of thumb is that probate attorney's fees and court fees could take over 4% of an estate's value.<sup>1</sup>
 *  **Publicity.** The probate process is public. When your will is admitted to probate, it becomes a public record, to be viewed by anyone who wishes to review it. Such transparency can create unwanted scrutiny.

With proper planning, the delays, costs, and loss of privacy can often be avoided.

You may be able to avoid probate and gain greater control over how your estate is settled by establishing and funding a revocable trust. Because the trust is revocable, it can be altered or amended during the grantor's<sup>2</sup> lifetime. After a grantor's death, the trust acts as a will substitute and enables the trustee to privately and quickly settle the grantor's estate without going through the probate process with respect to assets held in the trust.

A grantor can also give the trustee the power to take immediate control of the assets held in trust in the event that the grantor becomes incapacitated (and the grantor generally has the ability to define what constitutes ""incapacity"" within the trust document). This provision can save heirs the time, financial cost, and emotional distress of going to court to request a conservatorship or guardianship over a loved one. Finally, revocable trusts are dissolvable, meaning the grantor can generally pull assets out of the trust at any point during the grantor's lifetime. 2. Preserve assets for heirs and favorite charities If you have substantial assets, you may want to consider creating and funding an irrevocable trust during your lifetime. Because the trust is irrevocable, in almost all circumstances, the grantor cannot amend the trust once it has been established, nor can the grantor regain control of the money or assets used to fund the trust. The grantor gifts assets into the trust, and the trustee administers the trust for the trust beneficiaries based on the terms specified in the trust document.

Significantly, while the gift could use up some or all of a grantor's lifetime gift tax exclusion, any future growth on these assets generally will not be includable in the grantor's estate and therefore will escape estate taxes at the grantor's death. The individual lifetime federal gift tax exclusion is set at $11.40 million for 2019.

Irrevocable trusts can also serve several specialized functions, including:

 *  **Holding life insurance proceeds outside your estate.** Generally, without trust planning, the death benefit payout from a life insurance policy would be considered part of an estate for the purposes of determining whether there are estate taxes owed. However, this is not the case if the policy is purchased by an independent trustee and held in an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) that is created and funded during the grantor's lifetime, with certain limitations (please consult your attorney).
    
    Despite not being subject to estate taxes at death, the life insurance proceeds received by the ILIT can be made available to pay any estate taxes due by having the insurance trust make loans to, or purchase assets from, the estate. Such loans or purchases can provide needed liquidity to the estate without either increasing the estate tax liability or changing the ultimate disposition of the assets, as long as the life insurance trust benefits the same beneficiaries as the estate does. In particular, this means that illiquid assets like real estate, or tax-inefficient assets like taxable retirement accounts, may not have to be sold or distributed quickly to meet the tax obligation.
 *  **Ensuring protection from creditors, including a divorcing spouse.** An irrevocable trust, whether created during your lifetime or at your death, can include language that protects the trust's assets from the creditors of, or a legal judgment against, a trust beneficiary. In particular, assets that remain in a properly established irrevocable trust are generally not considered marital property. Therefore, they generally won't be subject to division in a divorce settlement if one of the trust's beneficiaries gets divorced. However, a divorce court judge may consider the beneficiary's interest in the trust when making decisions as to what constitutes an equitable division of the marital property that is subject to the court's jurisdiction.

Keep in mind, though, that irrevocable trusts are permanent. ""The trust dictates how the funds are distributed, so you want to fund this type of trust only with assets that you are certain you want to pass to the trust beneficiaries, as specified by the terms of the trust,"" cautions Weaver. 3. Reduce estate taxes for married couples For a married couple, a revocable trust may be used as part of the larger plan to take full advantage of both spouses' federal and/or state estate tax exclusions. Upon the death of a spouse, the assets in a revocable trust can be used to fund a family trust—also known as a ""credit shelter,"" ""bypass,"" or ""A/B"" trust—up to the amount of that spouse's federal or state estate tax exclusion. The assets held in the family trust can then grow free from further estate taxation at the death of the surviving spouse. Meanwhile, the balance of the assets in the revocable trust can be transferred to the surviving spouse free of estate tax pursuant to the spousal exemption. At the death of the surviving spouse, of course, these assets may be included in the surviving spouse's estate for estate tax purposes.

The estate tax-free growth potential for funds in a family trust can be significant. Say, hypothetically, that you and your spouse live in Florida, which does not have a separate state-level estate tax, and have a net worth of $20 million. If one of you dies in 2019, that spouse's revocable trust can fund the family trust with $11.40 million without paying any federal estate tax. Over the next 20 years, this $11.40 million could grow in value, all of which would remain outside the surviving spouse's taxable estate. 4. Gain control over the distribution of your assets By setting up a trust, the grantor is able to establish ways that the assets are to be passed on to the beneficiaries. For example:

 *  **Distributions for specific purposes.** A grantor can stipulate that the trustees of a trust shall make money available to children or grandchildren only for college tuition or perhaps for future health care expenses.
 *  **Age-based terminations.** This provision can stipulate that the trust's assets shall be distributed to heirs at periodic intervals—for example, 30% when they reach age 40, 30% when they reach age 50, and so on.

If you are charitably inclined, you may also want to consider establishing a charitable remainder trust, which allows the grantor, and possibly the grantor's spouse and children, to receive an annual payment from the trust during their lifetime, with the balance transferring to the specified charity when the trust terminates. The grantor may also receive an income tax charitable deduction based on the charity's remainder interest when property is contributed to the charitable remainder trust. 5. Ensure that your retirement assets are distributed as you've planned You may be concerned that a beneficiary of a retirement account will liquidate that account and incur a large income tax obligation in that year as a result. To help alleviate that concern, by naming a properly created trust as the beneficiary of a retirement account at the grantor's death, the trustee can limit withdrawals to the retirement account's required minimum distributions (RMDs), required of each beneficiary. 6. Keep assets in your family You may be concerned that if your surviving spouse remarries, your assets could end up benefiting their new family rather than your own loved ones. In this case, a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust provision can be used to provide for a surviving spouse while also ensuring that at their subsequent death, the remainder of the trust's assets are ultimately transferred to the beneficiaries identified by the grantor in the trust document. Building your legacy The purpose of establishing a trust is to ultimately help you better realize a vision for your estate and, in turn, your legacy. Therefore, it's important to let your goals for your estate guide your discussion with your attorney and financial advisor as they help determine what kind of trust and provisions make sense for you. It is vitally important that the trust be properly drafted and funded, so that you and your beneficiaries can fully realize all the benefits available.

14,2272,6 key Medicare questions,['Health Care & Wellness'],"['Health Savings Account', 'Long-Term Care Insurance', 'Medical Insurance']","['Health', 'Medicare', 'Retirement', 'Social Security']","['Annuities', 'Health insurance', 'Insurance services', 'Retirement accounts', 'Retirement tools', 'Social Security Benefits Calculator']",6 key Medicare questions,6 key Medicare questions,6 key Medicare questions,"Learn about Medicare eligibility, choices, costs, and when and how to sign up.","Get answers to questions about eligibility, choices, costs, and when and how to sign up.","Get answers to questions about eligibility, choices, costs, and when and how to sign up."," 6 key Medicare questions  *  What is Medicare?

 *  Where can I go for help with Medicare? Diane turned 65. Having also retired, she filled her days with volunteer work, babysitting her grandchildren, and enjoying time with her friends.

Diane was the first among her friends to turn 65 and enroll in Medicare. This made her the go-to expert for all things health care-related.

As her friends neared 65, they called Diane for help. Since she had made her way through the Medicare maze, they figured Diane could answer their questions.

Her friends' health care needs weren't the same as Diane's. She pointed them to places where she had found information but wasn't able to give them the specific answers they needed for their unique situations. She didn't feel ready for Medicare, and neither did her friends.

To help you prepare for enrolling in Medicare with confidence, here are answers to some of the most common questions people like you ask. 1. What is Medicare? You may have an idea of what Medicare is, based on what you've read or heard up to this point. But, not everyone describes it the same way.

As the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (they're the official federal organization responsible for Medicare) describe it, Medicare is a federal health insurance program for:

 *  People age 65 and older
 *  Certain younger people with disabilities
 *  People with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which is permanent kidney failure that requires dialysis or a kidney transplant Getting started with a few Medicare basics You might not know that Medicare only offers individual coverage. Unlike health insurance plans before age 65, there is no family coverage plan with Medicare. That means your spouse or partner won't be covered by your Medicare coverage; they have to enroll on their own when they become eligible for Medicare.

Medicare gives you a 7-month time frame to sign up/enroll. For those who are eligible when they turn 65, that 7 months begins 3 months before the month you turn 65 and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. This is the Initial Enrollment Period.

Medicare offers a Special Enrollment window for people age 65 who are still working and/or have health insurance through their employer or spouse's employer. This window is also available to you if certain events happen in your life, such as moving or losing other insurance coverage.

If you miss the Initial Enrollment Period without qualifying for the Special Enrollment Period, you may have a big gap in your health care coverage. You would have to wait until the following January when the General Enrollment Period begins (it ends in March).

But here's where missing the Initial Enrollment Period can hurt you: Signing up between January and March means your coverage doesn't go into effect until the following July—and you'll be charged a late enrollment penalty that's tacked on to your monthly premium (what you pay each month for health care coverage). 2. What are my options? Before Medicare, picking health insurance coverage while working for your previous employers was fairly straightforward: You picked a single plan for your doctor visits, prescriptions, and medical needs.

Medicare is very different. Medicare is made up of parts. Each part covers different things.

And to make it a little more complicated, each part has lots of different options within them. Let's take a look: Part A: Hospital insurance Medicare Part A coverage was first introduced in 1965 to help seniors manage the high cost of hospital care. Part A covers hospital visits, certain hospital treatments and procedures, skilled nursing facility care, and hospice care. Part B: Medical insurance Medicare Part B covers certain health care costs not covered by Part A, such as doctor visits and services, outpatient hospital care, physical and speech therapy, lab tests, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, and ambulance services.

Part A and Part B together are also known as **Original Medicare**. Medigap (Medicare Supplement) A Medigap policy is private health insurance that helps supplement Original Medicare. This means it helps pay some of the health care costs that Original Medicare doesn't cover (such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). These are ""gaps"" in Medicare coverage. If you have Original Medicare and a Medigap policy, Medicare will pay its share of the Medicare-approved amounts for covered health care costs. Then your Medigap policy pays its share.

While the federal government provides Parts A and B, private health insurance companies offer Medigap plans. There's a wide variety of Medigap plans to choose from that address services you need that Parts A and B don't cover.

**Tip:** You can find out which insurance companies sell Medigap policies in your area at [Medigap Policy Search](http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/medigap-home.aspx) and read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Medigap 101: What you need to know](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/medigap-what-you-need-to-know) Part D: Prescription drug coverage Original Medicare and Medigap plans do not provide prescription drug coverage, which means you may want to purchase a Part D plan or a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription drug coverage. Enrolling in a Part D plan is not required. However, if you don't enroll in a Part D plan when you first become eligible you may wind up getting penalized financially should you enroll later.

Regardless of the coverage you choose for prescription drugs, it's important to consider the ones that cover the medications you need, how often you need them, and where you purchase them. Medicare Advantage This coverage is an alternative to Part A, Part B, and Medigap. Medicare Advantage (which is also called Medicare Part C) is an ""all-in-one"" managed care plan that provides the coverage you'd find under Original Medicare and Medigap, and can also include Part D prescription drug coverage, vision coverage, or dental care.

Sounds great, right? Well, there's a catch. Medicare Advantage plans provide coverage for what's called ""in-network services."" Each Medicare Advantage plan works with a network of doctors and health care facilities. Most Medicare Advantage plans require a beneficiary to go through their network for services, but plans vary: For example, while HMOs provide only in-network services, PPOs have a network but allow you to go out-of-network with higher cost sharing.

**Tip:** If you're considering a Medicare Advantage plan, think about which doctors you see, what your current medical needs are (such as prescription medications) and whether the doctors you now see are in-network for the Medicare plan you're considering. If they aren't in-network, would you mind switching doctors? 3. How do I sign up? You may know which Medicare coverage you will choose. But how do you go about making it official? Parts A and B 1.  Apply online at Social Security. If you started your online application and have your re-entry number, you can go back to Social Security to finish your application.
2.  Visit your local Social Security office.
3.  Call Social Security at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778). Medicare Advantage There are a few options for signing up for a Medicare Advantage plan. You can enroll during:

 *  The same enrollment period for Parts A and B (3 months before the month you turn 65 to 3 months after the month you turn 65).
 *  The annual Open Enrollment Period for Medicare Advantage plans, which starts on October 15 and ends December 7. You can also switch or drop a Medicare Advantage plan during this time. To enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you must be enrolled in Part A and Part B.
 *  The Special Enrollment Period, which depends on your personal situation. [The Medicare website](https://www.medicare.gov/index) provides more details about this kind of period.

How you enroll (an online form, a paper application, over the phone) depends on whether you go through a health insurance company, an agent, or a health insurance marketplace website. Medigap If you are 65 or older, you have a so-called guaranteed issue right within 63 days of when you lose or end certain kinds of health coverage. At this point, companies must sell you a Medigap policy at the best available rate, regardless of your health status. They cannot deny you coverage. You can purchase a Medigap plan through a health insurance company, an agent, or a health insurance marketplace when you are first eligible for Medicare or during the Medicare Open Enrollment Period. Some insurance companies may allow the purchase of a Medigap plan at different times of the year. Part D If you're new to Medicare, you might consider enrolling in a prescription drug plan during the Initial 7-month Enrollment Period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, depending on your coverage needs. A person enrolled in a Medicare drug plan may owe a late enrollment penalty if they go without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage for any continuous period of 63 days or more after the end of their Initial Enrollment Period for Part D coverage. After you enroll, you can always change to a different prescription drug plan during the annual Open Enrollment Period from October 15 to December 7. 4. What do the plans cost? Bear in mind that you and your spouse will make separate purchasing decisions since all Medicare policies are individual policies. Part A As long as you or your spouse or partner paid Medicare taxes for at least 40 quarters (approximately 10 years), Part A coverage is free. But you are still responsible for paying a deductible per each benefit period ($1,364 in 2019), and a daily coinsurance for extended hospital stays.

Individuals who don't qualify for free Part A because they didn't pay Medicare taxes long enough can purchase Part A coverage (in 2019, $437 monthly if you paid Medicare taxes for less than 30 quarters; and $240 monthly if you paid Medicare taxes 30–39 quarters). Part B Medicare sets the cost (premium) for Part B each year at a fixed rate for most participants ($135.50 a month for 2019), but it increases for individuals with an annual income over $85,000 and married couples with an annual income above $170,000. The cost for these higher-earning participants can range from $189.60 to $460.50 per month in 2019. [Part B premiums](https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/part-b-costs/part-b-late-enrollment-penalty) also can be higher if you don't enroll when you're first eligible, unless one of the exceptions discussed above applies. A 10% penalty fee per each year you missed enrolling on time is added to the premium—for the rest of your life.

As with Part A, you will pay an annual deductible for Part B ($185 in 2019). And some covered services require that you pay a percentage of the charges or a copayment amount approved by Medicare (which is 20% of costs for many items or services).

If you are already receiving Social Security benefits, payment for your monthly Part B premium is deducted from your Social Security checks. If you're not yet collecting benefits, Social Security will send you a quarterly bill. Medicare Advantage When you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you continue to pay premiums for your Part B benefits. Everyone who enrolls in the same Medicare Advantage plan pays the same premium, regardless of age, gender, or health status.

**Tip:** You can compare Medicare Advantage plans in your area with Medicare.gov's [Medicare Plan Finder](https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx). Part D The amount that insurance companies charge for prescription drug coverage differs. The variation is based on how health insurance companies set up their deductibles and copayments, and the brand name and generic drugs (drug formulary) they cover.

For higher income individuals and couples, you'll pay more in monthly premiums for Part D coverage. [Premiums (PDF)](http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10536.pdf) vary depending on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) and marital status.

There is also an unpopular feature of all Part D coverage plans known as the ""donut hole"" (that is, a temporary limit on what Medicare will pay for your prescription drug costs). After you and your plan have spent $3,820 on covered drugs, you enter into the donut hole coverage gap and become responsible for paying a much greater percentage of the cost of each prescription until you reach catastrophic coverage levels under your plan, at which point your cost-sharing responsibility significantly decreases again. In 2019, once you are in the donut hole, you'll pay no more than 25% of the plan's cost for covered branded drugs and 37% of the price of covered generic drugs.

**Tip:** Compare Part D costs at [Medicare.gov](http://www.medicare.gov/) or your local State Health Insurance and Assistance Programs (SHIP) office. Medigap Although the benefits offered under a Medigap plan are standardized across the country, premiums for these plans vary. If you plan to purchase a Medigap plan, compare costs before you buy one. Medigap policies are priced 3 ways: (1) Community rated (i.e., priced the same for all enrolled in the same Medigap plan); (2) Issue-age rated (based on your age at the time of application); and (3) Attained-age rated (based on your current age and continues to increase as you get older). Bottom line: Your premium varies by the way the insurance company has priced their plan, along with your geographical location, gender, and smoking status. 5. Which plan is right for me? To figure out which Medicare option is the right one for you, it's always good to start by looking at the coverage you have now with your current health care insurer. What would you keep or change?

Narrow your options by asking yourself:

 *  How much can I afford to spend to pay for my insurance (premiums) and to pay for my care (in the form of deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance)?
 *  What benefits do I need? (You might save money if you don't buy coverage for benefits you don't mind paying for out of pocket.)
 *  Do I want to choose my own doctors or health care providers?
 *  Does the plan include coverage for my unique situation? (Paying for emergencies outside your state or country may be important if you plan to travel.)
 *  How does the cost of each plan compare with other plans that have the same benefits?

**Tip:** [Medicare.gov](http://www.medicare.gov/) and your local SHIP office can help you compare plan features and costs for Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans in your state. 6. Where can I go for more help? Now that you have the answers to some common Medicare questions, you're likely to have more questions. There are good sources of information available that can provide answers:

 *  The official Medicare site, [Medicare.gov](http://www.medicare.gov/), offers several helpful guides and interactive tools to help you compare your options
 *  The [Social Security site](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/) for guidance with Original Medicare
 *  Your local SHIP office for free one-on-one help from a SHIP program counselor. Plus, SHIP offices offer additional services, seminars, and publications to help you. Plan ahead Having the right Medicare coverage is a key part of your retirement plan—along with your overall health and wellness in retirement. Among the many factors to consider in your Medicare decision: health status, cost, coverage, amount of travel you plan to do, and access to existing or preferred doctors and hospitals.

15,9237,4 money topics couples should talk about,['Financial Planning'],,"['Beneficiaries', 'Planning your estate']","['401(k)', 'Estate planning', 'FidSafe', 'Fidelity Estate Planner', 'Retirement accounts']",4 money topics couples should talk about,Couples and money,Couples and money,"Discuss accounts, beneficiaries, an emergency plan, and important documents.","If you can't talk to your partner about money, who can you talk to?","Every couple manages money differently, but there are 4 money topics you really need to talk about."," Key takeaways  *  Put together a list of financial accounts.
 *  Name your account beneficiaries.
 *  Plan for the worst-case scenario.
 *  Make sure you and your partner know where important documents are. Many married couples suffer from a failure to communicate. A 2018 Fidelity survey found that 1 in 7 couldn't accurately report their spouses' employment status.<sup>1</sup> More than 4 in 10 couples disagree on when to retire—and more than half aren't on the same page about how much to save for retirement.

""That may not be surprising, since money can be a tricky topic in families,"" says Ann Dowd, CFP, a Fidelity vice president. ""But not laying the groundwork for open money communications can undermine relationships.""

For example, our survey found that among the 36% of couples concerned about debt, nearly half cite money as their biggest relationship challenge. They were also more likely than couples who weren't worried about debt to have difficulty talking about money in general.

Don't let that happen to you. Consider these 4 easy steps to help get your money talks off to a strong start. 1. List all your financial accounts Chances are each of you has a number of financial accounts—checking, savings, credit card, investment, 401(k), IRA, for example. Consider sharing the accounts you each have and where they are. Creating a spreadsheet with account numbers is a great way to keep track of them. Hopefully you feel comfortable enough with your partner to share any passwords or PINs that could be needed in a pinch. Taking an inventory of your accounts can help you get organized, which is never a bad thing. It can also help lay the foundation for investment decisions—which you may choose to make as a household or as individuals.

Consider using secure virtual safes like [FidSafe](http://www.fidsafe.com/)<sup>®2</sup> to store the list. 2. Name account beneficiaries Having a named beneficiary for retirement and investment accounts and insurance policies is as important as writing a will. Assets in these accounts pass directly to the beneficiaries you've designated with your account custodian, trustee, or plan administrator—and generally supersede any instructions in your will.

It’s not hard to name—or update—beneficiaries on financial accounts. Most financial service providers let you do it online. Naming beneficiaries on all accounts can help avoid legal complications in the event of a death.

**Retirement accounts.** You can name beneficiaries on your retirement accounts, such as 401(k) accounts and IRAs. If you are married, keep in mind that some employer-sponsored retirement plans automatically designate your spouse as the beneficiary unless you name another beneficiary and your spouse has consented in writing. Check with your company.

**Nonretirement accounts.** Designating beneficiaries on a nonretirement bank account or brokerage account may establish a ""transfer-on-death"" (TOD) registration for the account. It allows ownership of the account to be transferred to a designated beneficiary upon your death.

**Insurance policies.** It's a good idea to check your insurance beneficiary designations. Your life insurance policies may not be something you think about often but it’s important that your beneficiaries reflect your current wishes. For example, if you forget to change the beneficiary after a big life event like a marriage or a divorce, insurance proceeds could go to the wrong person if anything were to happen to you. 3. Prepare for the unexpected No matter your age, it makes sense to be prepared for the unexpected. Each half of a couple should have these 3 documents and discuss their wishes with the other:

**A will or a living trust and ""pour-over"" will combination.** A will is an essential legal document that sets forth your wishes regarding the distribution of your property and the care of any minor children when you die. A pour-over will is established by an individual, often in conjunction with a trust. Upon the death of the individual, all or a portion of their assets can be transferred—or ""poured over""—to a trust. By doing so, an individual can ensure that their estate has explicit directions on moving estate assets to a trust. Additionally, a properly structured pour-over may alleviate the burden of requiring the estate to undergo an often costly and lengthy public probate process.

**A power of attorney** appoints an agent to act on your behalf regarding financial and other matters while you are alive. It can be a durable power of attorney, which takes effect immediately—or a springing power of attorney, which takes effect if you become incapacitated and unable to handle matters on your own.

**A health care proxy** names a person, or persons, who can make health care decisions for you if you are unable to communicate or don't have the capacity to make decisions.

You may also want to draft an advance medical directive, also known as a ""living will."" In general, it outlines your wishes regarding life-prolonging medical treatments and may vary depending on your state of residence. It becomes effective only under the circumstances stated in the document.

Organize important legal documents The last 2 years of tax returns, marriage and birth certificates, insurance policies, wills, and health care proxies are a few of the things both partners need to know where to find. Designate a specific place for them. You can either store your estate plan and other important documents in your attorney's office or select a fireproof place—such as a bank safety deposit box—that someone close to you can access in an emergency. Again, consider using secure virtual safes like [FidSafe](http://www.fidsafe.com/)<sup>®2</sup> to store copies of important documents and other information, such as passwords, financial statements, and wills. Talk to your partner about money Of course, there are many more financial issues for partners to talk about, but these 4 are essential. Once you have the initial talk, revisit money issues regularly—consider reviewing your accounts together at least once a year. A convenient time to touch base may be at the end of the year, at the beginning of the year, or when you are preparing tax returns."

 *  If you have significant debt, look for a house up to 3 times your annual income. Homeownership is practically a part of the American dream. Before you start dreaming of a picket fence, take the time to make sure that buying a home is the best decision for you right now. Once you're sure that buying is better for you than renting, the next decision is how much house will be suitable for your family and your budget. (Try our [rent vs. buy calculator](https://communications.fidelity.com/pi/calculators/rent-vs-buy/) if you're not sure.)

""One big mistake that many first-time homebuyers often make is not factoring the household's current debt situation into the decision-making process,"" says Beau Zhao, a director in Fidelity's Strategic Advisers, Inc.

You may be able to avoid this mistake by using these simple rules of thumb for determining how much house you can afford. First: Determine how much house Using a factor of your household income, you can quickly gauge how much house you can afford. The total house value should be a maximum of 3 to 5 times your total household income, depending on how much debt you currently have.

 *  If you are completely debt free, congratulations—you can consider houses that are up to 5 times your total household income.
 *  If less than 20% of your income goes to pay down debt, a home that is around 4 times your income may be suitable.
 *  If more than 20% of your monthly income goes to pay down existing debts in the household, dial the purchase price to 3 times.

One of the major factors that determines how much house you can afford is your debt-to-income ratio—that is, your monthly debt obligations divided by your monthly income. Generally, lenders like to keep that ratio around 36%–42%. If you have no preexisting debt, a lender might approve a loan that would bring your debt-to-income ratio up to 42%.

We assume 36% as the baseline maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have in the analysis. Because both your existing debts and your future mortgage payments are components of your household debts, the sum of both should not exceed this 36%. Using this metric, we can solve for the suitable home price so that your household has a healthy, manageable debt-to-income ratio. Be cautious. Buying the biggest home you can afford means you have to obtain a large mortgage. This means sizable monthly payments—which might make it hard to meet your other financial priorities. A good rule of thumb is to hold your housing costs to about 30% of your monthly income. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development considers families who pay more to be ""cost burdened""; such families may have difficulty covering other important expenses.

Try this simple calculator to find out [how much house you can afford](https://communications.fidelity.com/pi/calculators/housing/). Second: Save at least your annual salary before taking any action Keep saving until you have saved an amount equal to your annual income. This should cover your down payment and the other expenses associated with buying a house. If you purchase a home that is 4 times your annual income, 1 times your income is 25% of the value of the home, accounting for a 20% down payment and other home-buying expenses. Consider saving this amount first before taking any action.

Paying a 20% down payment is the ideal option in most cases, because you can avoid private mortgage insurance and save money in the long run. If you have trouble paying for a 20% down payment but still want the big house you've always dreamed of, you could benefit from selecting a nonconforming loan, like an FHA loan.

Note: You don't have to borrow the full amount a mortgage lender will give you. ""Just because a bank tells you that you can borrow $300,000 doesn't mean that you should,"" cautions Zhao. ""And always compare all mortgage options available to you, because there might be a better option.""

This is an important step, because you don't want to have any unwanted surprises from the lender after you find a house you want to buy. It's always good to know whether your current credit qualifies for a good mortgage beforehand. The lender will evaluate your savings, income, and credit score to roughly determine how much you can borrow.

It's important to verify that your credit reports from the 3 credit bureaus reflect accurate information and that everything is up to date. Making sure your credit score is as high as possible can help you get a better mortgage rate, and that can save thousands of dollars in the long run. Other costs to think about The cost of a home is more than just a down payment and monthly mortgage payments. During the home-buying process, you'll need an appraisal to verify that the home is worth the price, and you'll be responsible for closing costs, which may amount to several thousand dollars. Ongoing costs include homeowners insurance, property taxes, and any homeowners association or condo fees.

And then, of course, there are the costs of maintaining and improving your home. Utilities in a house may cost more than the utilities in an apartment because of increased square footage. Plus, that lawn won't mow itself. Paying for monthly or weekly trims—or a lawnmower—may need to be in your budget.

New homeowners are often surprised by the unexpected costs that come up in the first few months. You want to make sure you have some savings set aside to take care of those expenses.

Don't forget about all your other priorities, such as saving for retirement and, if you have kids, their college education. If buying a house would put such a crunch on your budget that it would put these goals in jeopardy, you might consider continuing to rent for a while.

Once you've reviewed your savings, considered your budget, and factored in your other priorities, you'll have a much better sense of how much house you can comfortably afford. And finally it's time for the fun part—shopping for your new home."

 *  If you're exploring ""second act"" employment, consider seeking employment opportunities that offer health insurance for your ""retirement job.""
 *  For many people, working in their 60s and beyond isn't primarily about paying the mortgage and paying down debt; it's about doing something where you can use your knowledge, skills, and experience to be productively engaged and have some fun too. For 67-year-old Marilyn Arnold, finances played a role in her decision to keep working when she retired 4 years ago from her position as a managing partner at New York Life Insurance Company after 29 years in the insurance business.

""I felt that if I could continue to work doing something I wanted to do and not have to start taking Social Security, or draw from my retirement funds too much, it would be a win all around,"" she says.

Tapping into her childhood love of sewing, she opened her own small business, Marilyn Arnold Designs, in Lee's Summit, Missouri. Her forte: creating pillows and blankets as keepsakes made from wedding gowns.

Many older Americans are continuing to work during retirement for a plethora of reasons—from a personal reward like rediscovering a childhood passion and staying socially connected with a network of people to doing something that provides a sense of purpose and a chance to give back.

A paycheck, too, is a silver lining for many workers who worry that they will outlive their money. Many people want to continue working well past ""normal retirement age."" But intentions and reality don't always match when it comes to working in retirement. In fact, according to a Fidelity-sponsored survey, only 3% of pre-retirees and 32% of recent retirees surveyed said they wanted to retire at or before age 60. Most wanted to keep working. However, 38% of recent retirees actually retired at or before age 60–many because of layoffs or forced early retirement. Bottom line: Far fewer people actually work in retirement than *say* that they want to work in retirement.

For some, saving more money for retirement earlier in their career may be a smart move, especially if they leave the workforce earlier than planned.

""People are clearly concerned about not having enough savings to last for their lifetime, especially since we're living longer, on average,"" says Chris Farrell, author of *[Unretirement: How Baby Boomers Are Changing the Way We Think About Work, Community, and the Good Life](http://www.amazon.com/Unretirement-Boomers-Changing-Think-Community/dp/1620401576/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*. ""For many people, earning an income well into the traditional retirement years shores up household finances. Their goal is to preserve their quality of life with age.""

The payback can be far more than purely financial, though, even if finances are a primary incentive. ""The activity of working, of using your brain, of interacting with others is extremely valuable for your health and your happiness,"" says Steven Feinschreiber, senior vice president of research in Fidelity's Financial Solutions, Inc. ""Research suggests that working can actually help you live a longer and healthier life.""

Regardless of why you decide to keep earning a paycheck in retirement, there are certain financial rules and regulations to keep in mind. Contributing to retirement accounts A key advantage of ongoing income is that you can regularly contribute to your retirement savings accounts, says Farrell.

For 2019, total contributions to all your traditional and Roth IRAs can be up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you're age 50 or older), or your taxable compensation for the year, if your compensation is less than this dollar limit, per Internal Revenue Service rules.

One caveat: You can't make regular contributions to a traditional IRA in the year you reach 70½ and thereafter. However, you can still contribute to a Roth IRA and make rollover contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA regardless of your age. You must also take the [required minimum distribution (RMD)](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/building-savings/learn-about-iras/required-minimum-distributions/overview) from your traditional IRA beginning at 70½, regardless of your work status. If you have a Roth IRA, RMDs don't apply to it during your lifetime.

Your 401(k), or similar employer-based retirement plan, is a different story. In general, you can continue stashing away money in your current employer-provided plan as long as you're still working there, even part-time. And you can delay taking your RMD until after you retire. You will, however, need to take the RMD from any former employer's plan beginning at age 70½, unless the money was rolled into your current employer's plan.

Employees may contribute up to $19,000 to their 401(k) plans in 2019, with a higher total contribution limit (employer plus employee) of $56,000. For those age 50 and older, an additional ""catch-up"" employee contribution of up to $6,000 is also allowed. ""To have enough money to pay for your expenses in retirement, we generally recommend saving at least 15% of your income per year,"" explains Feinschreiber. ""That's total—your contributions and your employer's combined, and assumes working to age 67. It may make sense to continue working past age 62, so you can contribute more to your 401(k) and other retirement savings accounts."" Social Security benefits Another plus of working longer is that you can delay filing for Social Security benefits. You can begin taking monthly Social Security retirement benefits at age 62, but the amount will be reduced by about 30% versus the amount you would receive if you wait until you're what Social Security calls full retirement age (FRA)—66 or 67 if you were born from 1943 to 1959; 67 if you were born in 1960 or later.

If you can delay Social Security beyond FRA, your Social Security benefits are boosted by 8% a year (over the amount at FRA) for every year you postpone receiving checks from your FRA to age 70. That's a powerful boost.

Earning income after you reach your FRA or older doesn't affect your benefits, no matter how much you earn. For those who opt to apply for benefits before they reach FRA and continue to earn income, there's a temporary hitch. By law, if you're younger than FRA and receiving Social Security benefits, you can earn up to $17,640 in 2019, according to [Social Security](http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/whileworking.htm) rules, without a reduction in your benefit amount.

If you're younger than FRA, and earn more than the limit, Social Security deducts $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above the threshold. In the year you reach FRA, $1 in benefits is deducted for every $3 you earn above a different limit. After that, there are no earnings tests and no benefit reductions based on earned income.

The ""earnings"" counted are what you make from your job and/or your net earnings from self-employment. These include bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay, because they're all based on employment, but do not include investments, pensions, and other retirement income, or veterans' or other government or military retirement benefits.

In truth, you don't ultimately lose any of your Social Security benefit due to earning more than the income limits. If you exceed the limit allowed from age 62 to 66, the funds you were docked will be returned to you in the form of a permanent increase that the Social Security Administration (SSA) recalculates for you. The SSA website stipulates that after you reach FRA, ""your benefit amount is recalculated to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings.""

""It can be a bit of a shock when the reduction happens,"" says Farrell. ""But you don't lose the benefit. Most people don't understand that.""

The good news is that your Social Security benefits can actually ramp up as a result of your employment after you reach FRA, because they are calculated using your highest 35 years of earnings. If your earnings after FRA would replace any of your 35 highest-earning years used to calculate your benefit, then the SSA will do a recalculation, and your monthly benefits will bump up accordingly.

Keep in mind, of course, that SSA benefit could be subject to income tax if you are also earning compensation from a job or self-employment. For more information, review the publication [How Work Affects Your Benefits](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-10069.pdf), on the Social Security website.

**Tip:** Even though your benefits are not lost from working and collecting Social Security at the same time, the earned income you receive while collecting Social Security could result in up to 85% of your Social Security income becoming subject to federal income taxes.

Only 25% of large companies offer health care benefits to retirees, down from 35% in 2004, according to a [2017 employer survey](https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2017-summary-of-findings/) by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

So if you're hunting for a new job in retirement, consider seeking an employer who offers health insurance while you are employed at your ""retirement job."" At the very least, continuing to earn some income can help defray your health care bills before and after Medicare kicks in at 65. ""Health care expenses are generally one of the largest expenses in retirement,"" notes Feinschreiber. Couples retiring at age 65 are expected to incur $285,000 in health care costs on average during their retirement years, according to the 2019 Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate by Fidelity Investments. The estimate doesn't include the added expenses of nursing home or long-term care and assumes traditional Medicare coverage. ""This is the money on top of Medicare,"" Feinschreiber says. ""So it's thousands of dollars per year, which may be more than many people can afford. Working longer, even part-time, can help.""

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [How to plan for rising health care costs](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/plan-for-rising-health-care-costs) Traditional pension plans Although increasingly rare these days, you or your spouse may have qualified for a defined benefit plan that guarantees a specific benefit or payout upon retirement. Make sure you fully grasp how your benefit is determined before you decide to stay or leave your job. If you've maximized your pension income, it may give you the financial freedom to pursue an ""encore"" career. Some defined benefit plans calculate your benefit based only on a precise number of years you have worked for your employer. So ask your HR representative if your plan stops earning benefits after 30 years, if your benefit is frozen, or whether your pay may impact your final benefit.

In some plans, the pension benefit is calculated as a percentage of earnings during your final years on the job. So if you enter a ""phased retirement"" working arrangement and trim back your hours and earnings during your last few years, you might shrink your pension benefits too.

For some, staying on job later in your career may have more to do with qualifying for a retiree medical benefit. For example, you may have been offered an early retirement option at age 54. However, if you stayed on the job for another year, you may have qualified for an early retirement subsidy or other benefits at age 55 because you would have worked for at least, say, 10 years for the same employer. Do your homework and know your options.

Lastly, even if your pension benefit has stopped accumulating, you may choose to stay on the job because you want to continue your employer-sponsored health care coverage until you reach Medicare eligibility at age 65.

**Tip:** Watch a short Fidelity Learning Center video: [Choosing your pension payout option](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/choosing-pension-payout-video) Impact on taxes According to Farrell, it's possible that staying on the job an extra couple of years might push you into a higher tax bracket, especially if you begin to take taxable distributions from your IRA, or other pension benefits that count as income on top of your salary.

Employees can avoid being tripped up by knowing how close their current earned income level may be to the next tax bracket, advises Feinschreiber. If you need more money to live on than you're earning, or are required to take an IRA distribution, try to avoid using any other tax-deferred accounts (that don't yet require a distribution). Instead, consider taking remaining funds from your after-tax accounts, such as your checking accounts, savings accounts, or brokerage accounts, for which the bulk of the money has already been taxed.

18,2105,Demystifying bond ETFs,['Stock market'],"['Active Trader Pro', 'Brokerage', 'Exchange-Traded Funds', 'Stocks']","['Investing strategies', 'Markets']",,Demystifying bond ETFs,Demystifying bond ETFs,Demystifying bond ETFs,"If you want the benefits of bonds, bond ETFs may be worth a look.","If you want the benefits of bonds, bond ETFs may be worth a look.","If you want the benefits of bonds, bond ETFs may be worth a look."," If you are looking for income, diversification, and exposure to a specific asset class, bonds can play an important role in your investment portfolio. When looking at the bond universe, bond mutual funds, bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and a diversified portfolio of individual bonds offer ways to obtain the benefits of fixed income.

Here are a few key things to know about bond ETFs—and some ETFs to consider. The big bond world When it comes to the bond market, you have a lot of choices. It can be a daunting task to assemble and maintain an appropriately diversified portfolio of individual bonds, given the size and diversity of the more than $100 trillion bond universe.<sup>1</sup>

Buying bonds in the past was more complicated, as the bond market used to be more opaque and fragmented. Today, with visibility into recent trades, depth of available inventory, and access to most of the available secondary market offerings, you are able to get a better snapshot of a bond’s value and its liquidity than ever before.

In addition, bond [mutual funds](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/fund-screener) and bond [ETFs](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/evaluator/goto/landing) are often a low-cost way to buy a diversified basket of bonds, even if you have a relatively small amount of money to invest. For a detailed comparison of the features of bonds, bond mutual funds, and bond ETFs, see the table. Bond funds up close While bond mutual funds have been around longer, bond ETFs are growing in popularity. Since the first US-listed bond ETF was launched in 2002, bond ETFs have accumulated over $800 billion in assets—although that is still a fraction of the roughly $3.6 trillion bond mutual fund market.<sup><font>2</font></sup>

Bond ETFs are similar to bond mutual funds in that both hold a basket of individual bonds and are professionally managed, either passively (the fund attempts to mirror the performance of a bond index or benchmark) or actively (the fund attempts to outperform a bond index or benchmark). To date, most bond ETFs are passively managed.

Both bond mutual funds and bond ETFs can provide exposure to a variety of markets, sectors, maturities, and credit qualities.

Their tax treatment is similar too. When it comes to individual bonds, you generally pay income taxes on interest received at ordinary income rates, unless the bond is tax-exempt, but you don’t pay capital gains taxes unless you sell the bond before maturity at a profit. With a bond ETF or fund, you will likely pay both income taxes on interest paid when you sell units of a fund, typically through a monthly dividend (e.g., a fund distribution), and capital gains if they are paid out, typically through an annual dividend (e.g., a fund distribution).

However, there are some differences. Whereas a bond mutual fund’s price is set at the end-of-day market price, a bond ETF is bought or sold at the intraday market price, which may be different than the [ETF's net asset value](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-nav) (NAV).<sup>3</sup>

Bond mutual funds generally provide holdings disclosures monthly and discourage short-term trading of fund shares. In comparison, the vast majority of bond ETFs are required to disclose their holdings daily to support daily exchange trading activity. Depending on distribution models and to control short-term trading, bond mutual funds may be subject to redemption or transaction fees; bond ETFs are not. Instead, bond ETFs are subject to bid-ask spreads and brokerage commissions or fees.

“Bond ETFs might be most appropriate for those fixed income investors who like the advantages of ETFs, including intraday trading and holdings transparency,” explains Lee Sterne, ETF strategist with Fidelity. “Bond ETFs let you tactically pick and choose when you want to enter and exit the market, based on prevailing market conditions.” Bond ETF risks Of course, just as bond ETFs provide certain advantages, they also have [risks](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/risks-with-etfs). Bond ETFs have risks similar to individual bonds and bond mutual funds, such as maturity, interest rate, and credit risk. Bond ETFs also have tracking risk (a measure of risk that is due to active management decisions made by the portfolio manager), and their potential valuation may be at a premium or discount to NAV. It is worth nothing that passively managed bond funds can also exhibit tracking risk.

Additionally, some bond ETFs may not have a long enough track record to analyze how they might react to different market conditions and phases of the business cycle. Abundance of bond ETF opportunities You should decide for yourself whether bond ETFs, bond mutual funds, or individual bonds are right for you. Or a combination of these different types of products might be suitable, depending on your specific investing objectives, risk constraints, and time horizon. Whatever route you choose, a strong case for active bond management can be made in today's market, given the size and complexity of the bond universe.

 *  Factors that will impact your personal savings goal include the age you plan to retire and the lifestyle you hope to have in retirement.
 *  If you're behind, don't fret. There are ways to catch up. The key is to take action. How much do you need to save for retirement? It's one of the most common questions people have. And no wonder. There are so many imponderables: When will you retire? How much will you spend in retirement? And for how long?

That's why we did extensive analysis to come up with age-based retirement savings factors that can help you plan—in spite of those uncertainties. These milestones are aspirational. You likely won't meet all of them. But they can serve as goalposts to help you make a plan to save enough to maintain your lifestyle in retirement. Our savings factors are based on the assumption that a person saves 15% of their income annually beginning at age 25, invests more than 50% on average of their savings in stocks over their lifetime, retires at age 67, and plans to maintain their preretirement lifestyle in retirement (see footnote 1 for more details).

Based on those assumptions, we estimate that saving 10x (times) your preretirement income by age 67, together with other steps, should help ensure that you have enough income to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. That 10x goal may seem ambitious. But you have many years to get there. To help you stay on track, we suggest these age-based milestones: Aim to save at least 1x your income by age 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, and 8x by 60. Your personal savings goal may be different based on various factors including 2 key ones described below. But these rules of thumb can provide a starting point to help your build your savings plan, and assess your progress.<sup>2,3</sup> 1. When you plan to retire The age you plan to retire can have a big impact on the amount you need to save, and your milestones along the way. The longer you can postpone retirement, the lower your savings factor can be. That's because delaying gives your savings a longer time to grow, you'll have fewer years in retirement, and your Social Security benefit will be higher.

Consider some hypothetical examples (see graphic). Max plans to delay retirement until age 70, so he will need to have saved 8x his final income to sustain his preretirement lifestyle. Amy wants to retire at age 67, so she will need to have saved 10x her preretirement income. John plans to retire at age 65, so he would need to have saved at least 12x his preretirement income.

Of course, you can't always choose when you retire—health and job availability may be out of your control. But one thing is clear: Working longer will make it easier to reach your savings goals. 2. How you want to live in retirement In other words, do you expect your expenses to go down when you retire? We call that a below average lifestyle. Or will you spend as much as you do now? That's average. If you expect your expenses will be more than they are now, that's above average.

Let's look at some hypothetical investors who are planning to retire at 67. Joe is planning to downsize and live frugally in retirement, so he expects his expenses to be lower. His savings factor might be closer to 8x than 10x. Elizabeth is planning to retire at age 67 and her goal is to maintain her lifestyle in retirement, so her savings factor is 10x. Sean sees retirement as an opportunity to travel extensively, so it may make sense for him to save more and plan for a higher level of retirement spending. His savings factor is 12x at age 67. Take stock [![Are you on track, get your savings factor](/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/RET/widget_10x_landing_inpage.jpg)](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/products/retirement/widget/xfactor/retire_xfactor.html) Our [simple widget](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/products/retirement/widget/xfactor/retire_xfactor.html) lets you see the impact of these 2 variables—when you plan to retire and what kind of lifestyle you want to live in retirement—on how much you need to have saved when you do retire, and on all the intermediate milestones.

What if you're behind? If you're under age 40, the simple answer is to save more and invest for growth through a diversified investment mix. Of course, stocks come with more ups and downs than bonds or cash, so you need to be comfortable with those risks. If you're over 40, the answer may be a combination of increased savings, reduced spending, and working longer, if possible.

No matter what your age, focus on the goals ahead. Don't be discouraged if you aren't at your nearest milestone—there are ways to catch up to future milestones through planning and saving. The key is to take action, and the earlier the better."

 *  The proportion of your preretirement expenses you'll need to cover in retirement, and how much of that will need to come from savings, may vary based on a variety of factors, including your retirement age, anticipated lifestyle in retirement, and current income.
 *  The higher your income, the higher the proportion of preretirement income you'll need to replace from personal savings. Have you ever found yourself lost when visiting a new place? Then you know how hard it can be to find something when you don't know where you are going. The same applies to saving for retirement—until you know the goal, it is hard to figure out if you are on the right path.

To simplify matters, Fidelity analyzed extensive spending data and found that most people needed to replace between 55% and 80% of their pretax, preretirement income after they stopped working to maintain their lifestyle in retirement.<sup>1</sup> Why the drop? Well, you likely won't be making contributions to retirement savings plans. And not working means potentially lower taxes, less need for certain forms of life insurance, and lower day-to-day expenses. After all, you don't need to pay for work clothes or commuting costs. You may also decide to pay off your mortgage.

Where will the money come from? The good news is that not all of it needs to come from savings. Social Security will likely cover some of your spending needs—relatively more for lower income earners than those who earned higher incomes (see graph below).

After that, Fidelity research finds that those with between $50,000 and $300,000 in annual income currently should plan for their savings (including pensions) to replace about 45% of their pretax, preretirement income.<sup>2</sup> The exact amount, of course, may vary depending on your income, retirement age, and other factors.<sup>3</sup> How much you earn matters Your salary plays a big role in determining what percentage of your income you will need to replace in retirement. People with higher incomes tend to spend a small portion of their income during their working years, and that means a lower income replacement goal in percentage terms to maintain their lifestyle in retirement.

As you can see in the chart below, someone who makes $50,000 might expect to need to replace around 80% of their pretax, preretirement income in retirement to maintain their standard of living, while someone who earns $200,000 might aim to replace closer to 60%. Social Security covers less for higher earners For many people, a significant portion of retirement income comes from Social Security, but that share is relatively higher for lower-income people. As you can see in the chart above, a person earning $50,000 a year could expect Social Security to replace about 35% of income, or $17,500, with the rest coming from savings. Someone who made $200,000 each year might expect to get 16% of that income from Social Security, or $32,000. If you made $300,000, only 11%, or $33,000, would likely come from Social Security. When you retire matters The age at which you stop working is another big factor in how much of your preretirement income you will need your savings to replace in retirement. Most people are eligible to receive Social Security benefits as early as age 62, but those benefits increase if you wait until your full retirement age (usually 67), and rise even more if you delay until age 70.

The earlier you retire, the more you will have to rely on savings to meet your income needs, because your Social Security payments will be lower (see chart). Let's consider Bill, who plans to claim his Social Security benefits as soon as he retires. Bill needs to replace 45% of his income from savings if he retires at age 67. If he stops working at 62, that number would go up to 55%. But it drops to 40% if he stays in the workforce until age 70. Delaying retirement gives you more time to save and higher Social Security benefits. Planning for retirement income Once you know where you are going, it becomes a lot easier to make a plan to get there, and to measure your progress along the way. When it comes to saving for retirement, set a course for maintaining your current lifestyle in retirement—and plan for your savings to provide 45% of your preretirement income.

Just remember that the amount of preretirement income you will need to replace from personal savings will depend on a variety of factors, including your retirement age and anticipated retirement lifestyle. As always, it can make sense to work through your plan with a financial advisor."

Yet most of us grapple with the same, sometimes elusive, questions, usually starting with ""How much money do I need to retire?""

Of course, no one knows the precise answers to these questions because you don't know what life—or the markets—will bring. Still, you need to know where you stand to make decisions along the way that will help you have choices as retirement nears. That's why we did the analysis and determined guidelines based on 4 key metrics: a yearly savings rate, a savings factor (savings milestones), an income replacement rate, and a potentially sustainable withdrawal rate to start you on the path to creating your retirement roadmap.

They are all interconnected, so it is important to keep each in mind, and to understand how they work together as you save for retirement and monitor your progress. We will focus on each metric—and associated guidelines—in separate articles, and we've included tools and interactive widgets to help you explore the impact of changing assumptions on these individual guidelines.

Here are 4 common retirement questions—and rules of thumb for each (assuming a retirement age of 67, which is the full Social Security benefits age for those born in 1960 or later). Of course, your particular needs may be different, which is why you should consider working with a professional to build a personalized plan. But the following guidelines offer a starting point.  *  **What will my savings cover in retirement?** For most people, Social Security will provide an income base in retirement with the rest coming from savings. But how much should you assume will come from savings? Fidelity's rule of thumb is to save enough to replace at least 45% of your preretirement income,<sup>1</sup> after accounting for Social Security.

 *  **How can I make my retirement savings last?** One of the most challenging questions many retirees face is how much to withdraw from their savings in retirement. Withdraw too much and you risk running out of money. Withdraw too little and you may not live the life you want to in retirement. Our guideline is to limit withdrawals to 4% to 5% of your initial retirement savings<sup>4</sup> , then keep increasing this withdrawal based on inflation.
    
    Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [How can I make my savings last?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/how-long-will-savings-last) Retirement age and Social Security benefits are key All these guidelines depend on a number of factors, especially the age at which you retire. The average retirement age in America is about 65 for men and 63 for women<sup>5</sup>. At 62, you can start claiming Social Security benefits. But postponing claiming can increase your monthly benefit by 8% every year you delay between age 62 and 70. Delaying can also extend the period over which your retirement savings can grow, and reduce the number of years to be funded by those savings.

So the age at which you choose to stop working can have a big impact on how much income you need from your own savings. This, in turn affects the values for other retirement guidelines—savings rate, savings factors, and sustainable withdrawal rates (see table). Remember, these guidelines are all linked together.

While you may not be able to pinpoint exactly how much income you may need in retirement, you probably have an idea about when you want to retire. If you're planning to retire early, you may want to use the rules of thumb for age 62. If you are planning to work longer, the rules for age 70 might be more appropriate for you. Things to keep in mind Our guidelines assume no pension income, and we make a number of other assumptions, including continuous employment, uniform wage growth, and contribution amounts increasing with the wage growth. We acknowledge that individual circumstances are different and may vary through time. That is why we have applied a “strong plan” framework to our analysis, stress testing these guidelines to be successful in 9 out of 10 market conditions across a broad range of investment mixes (see footnotes for methodology and other key assumptions<sup>6</sup>).

 *  Rebalancing into beaten-down types of investments can help you manage your portfolio's risk level and be positioned for a potential recovery.
 *  To make the most of a bad market, consider taking advantage of lower-cost investments through a disciplined strategy. For investors, a market pullback can be a painful thing—no one likes to see the value of their account go down. But every downturn comes with potential opportunities. One upside: While the investments you hold may be dropping in value, the investments you may want to buy could be getting cheaper. Also, some transactions may get more appealing when market prices fall.

As anyone who has been following the market knows, it is impossible to predict how long a market trend will last, whether prices are rising or falling. ""Emotions run particularly high when markets fall, but savvy investors learn to rise above their fears and seize the opportunities that arise,"" says Ann Dowd, CFP<sup>®</sup> and vice president at Fidelity.

Here are 4 strategies for investors to consider to help find some upside in a down market. 1. Stay disciplined to seize opportunities Some investors have a tendency to try to time the market in an attempt to avoid downturns and capture gains—but most are not very successful. History shows that, in aggregate, many investors often buy into markets near peaks and sell near bottoms. For example, there were big inflows into stocks in 2000 and 2007, just before market peaks, and dramatic outflows in 2008 and 2009, right before the market took off (see chart). Instead of trying to jump in and out of the market, you can reality-check your investment mix to be sure it is still right for your goals and risk tolerance. Most investors have long-term goals, and plans built to work through ups and downs over time. If that's the case, it makes sense to keep a long-term perspective and continue to save and invest.

Consider a dollar-cost-averaging strategy by putting a set dollar amount into a portfolio each month. While dollar-cost averaging won't insulate you from losses or guarantee a profit in a volatile market, investors will purchase more shares when prices are lower, and fewer when they are higher. But for dollar-cost averaging to be effective, an investor must continue to make investments in both up and down markets. 2. Consider rebalancing Assuming you're comfortable with your investment plan, check to see whether your asset mix may have veered off course due to the recent market pullback. If so, consider rebalancing to your target mix. Rebalancing into investments that have lost value during a down market means investors may invest at a lower price.

Consider a quick example. Say Amy (a hypothetical investor) rebalances annually. Imagine that this year, the large-cap portion of her portfolio has declined, and small caps lost even more, while bonds produced smaller losses. Her instinct may be to buy more bonds and avoid buying the losers, but buying the losers is precisely what rebalancing means—buying more small- and large-cap stocks, either by reallocating her investments or putting new money to work.

""The beauty of rebalancing and dollar-cost averaging is that it helps an investor buy low—when investments are effectively on sale—countering our natural tendency to do just the opposite,"" says Dowd. ""Over time, that discipline can pay off."" 3. Consider putting your losses on the books Down markets also provide an opportunity to boost after-tax returns by taking capital losses. This strategy, called tax-loss harvesting, involves selling stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that have lost value to help reduce taxes on realized capital gains from winning investments. If your losses exceed your gains, realized capital losses can be used to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year. Any unused losses can be carried over to future years.

How can an investor take advantage of this opportunity without throwing off an investment strategy? Consider selling investments that no longer fit a strategy, or ones with poor prospects, which an investor may want to sell regardless of the tax impact.

Or, consider looking for investments to sell that can be replaced by similar investments, keeping an overall investment mix on track. But be careful. To qualify for the tax-loss benefit, an asset that is purchased within 30 days of a sale, cannot be ""substantially identical"" (as defined by the IRS). Remember, tax rules are complex, and [you should get more details](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/tax-loss-harvesting) or talk to a financial planning or tax professional for more information.

""Investors shouldn't let taxes drive their investing decisions, but downturns do provide the potential to record losses, and reduce taxes,"" says Dowd. 4. Consider a Roth IRA conversion Roth IRAs have several benefits, including the potential for tax-free withdrawals,\* and no required minimum distributions during the lifetime of the original account owner. To qualify to make a contribution, a person must have earned income, and stay under an income limit.

If you are married filing jointly you can contribute up to the limit of $6,000 ($7,000 for those 50 years or older) to your Roth IRA if your MAGI is less than $196,000. Your contributions will be reduced if your MAGI is between $196,000 and $206,000.

Don't meet those income requirements? Not to worry. Anyone can convert all or part of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA as long as they pay income taxes on the money at the time of the conversion. And a market downturn may be a particularly good time to consider a conversion, because the taxation would likely apply to a smaller conversion amount. Investors may want to convert a certain dollar amount, in which case a downturn would allow them to move more shares.

Roth conversions are complicated, however, so consult a tax professional and seek more information. The bottom line An investment strategy is meant to work over the long term through market ups and downs, so investors need to keep a short-term pullback in perspective.

Markets will rise and markets will fall, and with the changes, opportunities will appear. To make the most of a bad market, consider taking advantage of lower-cost investments through a disciplined strategy, while looking to take advantage of the potential tax benefits of a downturn.

 *  Flexibility may be a consideration as well: A Roth IRA allows you to withdraw your contributions anytime, with no taxes or penalties due.
 *  It may make sense to contribute to both types of IRAs if you are eligible, so you have tax-free and taxable options when you withdraw the money in retirement.
 *  To make the most of your IRA savings, invest the money for long-term growth. You're ready to save for retirement in an IRA. But wait, there are 2 types of IRAs—a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. Which one should you choose? You may be able to contribute to both types. Here are some things to keep in mind as you decide which is the appropriate choice for you now.

First, the basics. Traditional and Roth IRAs are both types of tax-advantaged accounts designed to help people save for retirement. For 2019 and 2020, eligible taxpayers can contribute up to $6,000 (or up to the level of earned income, if lower) to a traditional IRA, or $7,000 if they have reached age 50.

The same amounts can be contributed to a Roth IRA, as long as your income (as defined by modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI) is not above the limits: The ability to contribute to a Roth IRA starts to phase out at $193,000 in 2019 and $196,000 in 2020, if you are married and file a joint return. If you are a single filer, the phase-out begins at $122,000 in 2019 and $124,000 in 2020.

There is an earned income requirement to contribute to an IRA. You, or your spouse, must have taxable earned income of at least your contribution amount. Which kind of IRA? With a **[traditional IRA](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/retirement-ira/traditional-ira)**, your contribution may reduce your taxable income and, in turn, your federal income taxes if you are eligible for the tax deduction.<sup>1</sup> Earnings can grow tax-deferred until withdrawn, although if you make withdrawals before age 59½, you may incur both ordinary income taxes and a 10% penalty. (There are a handful of situations that may qualify for waiving the early withdrawal penalty.) After age 59½, you may make withdrawals of any amount without penalty, but federal and state taxes, if applicable, will apply. Starting in the year you reach age 70½, you will need to begin taking at least the required minimum distributions (RMDs) and paying ordinary income taxes on the distribution amount.

To estimate your tax savings on a traditional IRA contribution, you'll need your marginal tax rate. Then multiply it by the amount of money you contributed to your traditional IRA. That's generally how much a traditional IRA may reduce your federal income tax. (Keep in mind that it's an estimate. In some cases your contribution can reduce your marginal tax rate, so your federal tax savings might be smaller. On the other hand, you might also save on state income taxes.) For a hypothetical example, a person with a 25% marginal federal income tax rate would save $1,375 in taxes on a contribution of $5,500, if the person is eligible for a tax deductible contribution to the IRA.

While everyone with earned income can contribute to a traditional IRA, if you and/or your spouse also have access to a workplace plan like a 401(k), your ability to deduct your traditional IRA contribution may be limited so you may want to prioritize the workplace plan. The most common types of workplace plans, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 457s allow participants to save more than 3 times the annual IRA contribution limit. Money saved in the traditional types of these accounts reduces your taxable income for the year. Saving first in the account that offers the biggest tax benefit could help you make the most of your savings.

With a **[Roth IRA](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/retirement-ira/roth-ira)**, your contribution isn't tax-deductible the year you make it, but your money can grow tax-free and your withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, provided that certain conditions are met.<sup>2</sup> Eligibility to contribute to a Roth depends only on MAGI—a retirement plan at work for you or your spouse is not a factor. As long as your MAGI is beneath the annual limit, you can contribute to a Roth IRA.<sup>3</sup>

Earnings on those contributions (although not the contributions themselves) may be subject to both tax and early withdrawal penalties if withdrawn before the qualifying criteria are met.<sup>2</sup> As with the traditional IRA, there are some circumstances that qualify for an exception to the 10% penalty—like buying a first home or paying qualified educational expenses. Because Roth contributions are made after taxes have been paid, you can withdraw your contributions anytime, with no taxes or penalties due.

Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not have RMDs (during the original owner's life). Spousal IRA If your spouse doesn't work, they can have a spousal IRA. This allows non-wage-earning spouses to contribute to their own traditional or Roth IRA, provided the other spouse is working and the couple files a joint federal income tax return. If the working spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, deductibility of contributions to a spousal traditional IRA would be phased out at higher incomes.<sup>1</sup> This means eligible married spouses can each contribute up to the contribution limit each year to their respective IRAs.<sup>4</sup> Spousal IRAs are also eligible for a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older. Making a decision [![More ways to save wtih IRA's video](/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/RET/save_withIRAs_pop.jpg)](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/more-ways-to-save-video) But tax rates don't tell the whole story. ""How disciplined you are at saving can also play a role in which type of account may better help you prepare for retirement,"" explains Matthew Kenigsberg, vice president of investment and tax solutions at Fidelity. Here's why. Generally, pre-tax contributions to a traditional IRA can help lower your taxable income, if you are eligible, giving you more money in your pocket. These tax savings help improve your retirement picture only if you're disciplined enough to save. If you tend to spend any money left at the end of the month, or any income tax refund, it's not going to help your bottom line when you retire. Of course, on the other hand, the tax savings may provide an extra incentive to save now that Roth IRAs don't offer.

With Roth IRA contributions, you pay taxes up front. But if you (like many people) tend to spend all your discretionary income, having less disposable income might be a good thing when it comes to your retirement savings.

""In a sense,"" says Kenigsberg, ""switching from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA forces you to save more for later by keeping less in your pocket now, assuming you keep making the same contribution.""

Roth IRAs have additional advantages that go beyond taxes. Because you don't need to take RMDs with a Roth (during the life of the original owner) and because the assets in a Roth account can be bequeathed to your heirs income tax-free, Roth accounts can be a useful estate planning tool.

Not eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA because your income is too high? You can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, though you will need to pay taxes on the conversion. (If you've made nonqualified contributions and include them in your converted balance, they won't be taxed.)

For a detailed look at tax-smart conversion strategies, read Viewpoints on Fidelity.com: [Answers to Roth conversion questions](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/roth-IRA-common-questions) Having it both ways It may be appropriate to contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA—if you can. Doing so will give you taxable and tax-free withdrawal options in retirement. Financial planners call this tax diversification, and it's generally a smart strategy when you're unsure what your tax picture will look like in retirement. (Remember, though, you can contribute only up to the contribution limit in any one year—so $6,000 in 2019 and 2020, plus $1,000 if you are age 50 or older—in total across all IRAs you own, whether traditional or Roth.)

For example, with a combination of traditional and Roth IRA savings, you could take distributions from your traditional IRA until you reach the top of your income tax bracket, and then withdraw whatever you need beyond that amount from a Roth IRA, which is tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.

On the other hand, taxes in retirement may not be the whole story. Reducing your current taxable income through traditional IRA contributions may also be advantageous for other reasons, such as qualifying for student financial aid.

There's still one more tax benefit available to some taxpayers: the saver's credit. The maximum credit available is $2,000. Eligibility is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Depending on your AGI, you could get a credit of up to 50% of your contribution to an IRA or workplace retirement plan. The amount of the credit goes down as income goes up, phasing out at $64,000 in 2019 and $65,000 in 2020 for joint filers. Investing an IRA contribution Many people make their IRA contribution just before the April tax deadline, and put it into a money market fund. Then they never go back and choose a growth-oriented investment. This is generally not ideal. One of the best ways to give the money a chance to grow over the long term is by having an age-appropriate level of diversified exposure to stocks—in the form of mutual funds, ETFs, and/or individual securities. Of course, that means getting used to riding the ups and downs of the market.

Consider this hypothetical projection: One $6,000 contribution could grow to approximately $64,000 in 35 years. For those age 50 or older, one $7,000 yearly contribution could grow to more than $74,700 in 35 years.<sup>5</sup> (We used a hypothetical 7% long-term compounded annual rate of return and assumed the money stays invested the entire time. Investments that have the potential to return 7% annually are generally those that come with some risk, such as stocks.)

If the $6,000 amount seems daunting, even if you can put only $550 into an IRA and leave it there invested for 35 years, earning a hypothetical annual return of 7%, it could be worth nearly $5,900 in 35 years. Make that $550 contribution every year and it could be worth over $87,000 after 35 years, using a hypothetical annual rate of return of 7%. (Note: These examples do not take into account taxes, inflation, or fees.)"

 *  For couples with big differences in earnings, consider claiming the spousal benefit, which may be better than claiming your own.
 *  A couple with shorter life expectancies may want to consider claiming earlier. Married couples may have some advantages when deciding how and when to claim Social Security. Even though the basic rules apply to everyone, a couple has more options than a single person because each member of a couple<sup>1</sup> can claim at different dates and may be eligible for spousal benefits.

Making the most of Social Security requires some strategy to take advantage of the basic benefit rules, however. After you reach age 62, for every year you postpone taking Social Security (up to age 70), you could receive up to 8% more in future monthly payments. (Once you reach age 70, increases stop, so there is no benefit to waiting past age 70.) Members of a couple may also have the option of claiming benefits based on their own work record, or 50% of their spouse’s benefit. For couples with big differences in earnings, claiming the spousal benefit may be better than claiming your own.

What's more, Social Security payments are guaranteed for life and should generally adjust with inflation, thanks to cost-of-living increases. Because people are living longer these days, a higher stream of inflation-protected lifetime income can be very valuable.

But to take advantage of the higher monthly benefits, you may need to accept some short-term sacrifice. In other words, you'll have less Social Security income in the first few years of retirement in order to get larger benefits later.

""As people live longer, the risk of outliving their savings in retirement is a big concern,"" says Ann Dowd, a CFP<sup>®</sup> and vice president at Fidelity. ""Maximizing Social Security is a key part of how couples can manage that risk.""

A key question for you and your spouse to discuss is how long you each expect to live. Deferring when you receive Social Security means a higher monthly benefit. But it takes time to make up for the lower payments foregone during the period between age 62 and when you ultimately chose to claim, as well as for future higher monthly benefits to compensate for the retirement savings you need to tap into to pay for daily living expenses during the delay period.

But when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse can claim the higher monthly benefit for the rest of their life. So, for a couple with at least one member who expects to live into their late 80s or 90s, deferring the higher earner's benefit may make sense. If both members of a couple have serious health issues and therefore anticipate shorter life expectancies, claiming early may make more sense.

How likely are you to live to be 85, 90, or older? The answer may surprise you. Longevity has been steadily increasing, and surveys show that many people underestimate how long they will live. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), a man turning 65 today will live to be 84.3 on average and a woman will live to be 86.6 on average. For a couple at age 65, the chances that one person will survive to age 85 are more than 75%. Further, the SSA estimates that 1 in 4 65-year-olds today will live past age 90, and 1 in 10 will live past age 95.<sup>2</sup>

**Tip:** To learn about trends in aging and people living longer, read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Longevity and retirement](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/longevity) Strategy No. 1: Maximize lifetime benefits A couple with similar incomes and ages and long life expectancies may maximize lifetime benefits if both delay. **How it works:** The basic principle is that the longer you defer your benefits, the larger the monthly benefits grow. Each year you delay Social Security from age 62 to 70 could increase your benefit by up to 8%.

**Who it may benefit:** This strategy works best for couples with normal to high life expectancies with similar earnings, who are planning to work until age 70 or have sufficient savings to provide any needed income during the deferral period.

**Example:** Willard's life expectancy is 88, and his income is $75,000. Helena's life expectancy is 90, and her income is $70,000. They enjoy working.

Suppose Willard and Helena both claim at age 62. As a couple, they would receive a lifetime benefit of $1,100,000. But if they live to be ages 88 and 90, respectively, deferring to age 70 would mean about $250,000 in additional benefits. Strategy No. 2: Claim early due to health concerns A couple with shorter life expectancies may want to claim earlier. **How it works:** Benefits are available at age 62, and full retirement age (FRA) is based on your birth year.

**Who it may benefit:** Couples planning on a shorter retirement period may want to consider claiming earlier. Generally, one member of a couple would need to live into their late 80s for the increased benefits from deferral to offset the benefits sacrificed from age 62 to 70. While a couple at age 65 can expect one spouse to live to be 85, on average, couples who cannot afford to wait or who have reasons to plan for a shorter retirement, may want to claim early.

**Example:** Carter is age 64 and expects to live to 78. He earns $70,000 per year. Caroline is 62 and expects to live until age 76. She earns $80,000 a year.

By claiming at their current age, Carter and Caroline are able to maximize their lifetime benefits. Compared with deferring until age 70, taking benefits at their current age, respectively, would yield an additional $113,000 in benefits—an increase of nearly 22%. Strategy No. 3: Maximize the survivor benefit Maximize Social Security—for you and your spouse—by claiming later. **How it works:** When you die, your spouse is eligible to receive your monthly Social Security payment as a survivor benefit, if it's higher than their own monthly amount. But if you start taking Social Security before your full retirement age (FRA), you are permanently limiting your partner's survivor benefits. Many people overlook this when they decide to start collecting Social Security at age 62. If you delay your claim until your full retirement age—which ranges from 66 to 67, depending on when you were born—or even longer, until you are age 70, your monthly benefit will grow and, in turn, so will your surviving spouse's benefit after your death. ([Get your full retirement age](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/retirechart.html))

**Who it may benefit:** This strategy is most useful if your monthly Social Security benefit is higher than your spouse's, and if your spouse is in good health and expects to outlive you. **Example:** Consider a hypothetical couple who are both about to turn age 62. Aaron is eligible to receive $2,000 a month from Social Security when he reaches his FRA of 66 years and 6 months. He believes he has average longevity for a man his age, which means he could live to age 85. His wife, Elaine, will get $1,000 at her FRA of 66 years and 6 months and, based on her health and family history, anticipates living to an above-average age of 94. The couple was planning to retire at 62, when he would get $1,450 a month, and she would get $725 from Social Security. Because they’re claiming early, their monthly benefits are 27.5% lower than they would be at their FRA. Aaron also realizes taking payments at age 62 would reduce his wife's benefits during the 9 years they expect her to outlive him. If Aaron waits until he's 66 years and 6 months to collect benefits, he'll get $2,000 a month. If he delays his claim until age 70, his benefit—and his wife's survivor benefit—will increase another 28%, to $2,560 a month. (Note: Social Security payout figures are in today’s dollars and before tax; the actual benefit would be adjusted for inflation and possibly subject to income tax.)

Waiting until age 70 will not only boost his own future cumulative benefits, it will also have a significant effect on his wife's benefits. In this hypothetical example, her lifetime Social Security benefits would rise by about $69,000, or 16%.

Even if it turns out that Elaine is overly optimistic and she dies at age 90, her lifetime benefits will still increase approximately 34% and she would collect approximately $129,000 more in Social Security benefits than if they had both claimed at 62 (vs. both waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security).

In situations where the spouse's Social Security monthly benefit is greater than their partner's, the longer a spouse waits to claim Social Security, the higher the monthly benefit for both the spouse and the surviving spouse. For more on why it's often better to wait until at least your FRA before claiming Social Security, read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Should you take Social Security at 62?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/social-security-at-62) In conclusion Social Security can form the bedrock of your retirement income plan. That's because your benefits are inflation-protected and will last for the rest of your life. When making your choice, be sure to consider how long you may live, your financial capacity to defer benefits, and the impact it may have on your survivors. Consider working with your Fidelity financial advisor to explore options on how and when to claim your benefits."

 *  ""Do-overs"" are allowed within 12 months of commencing benefit payments.
 *  Earnings test may apply if you claim early. Do you plan to work for income after you retire? If so, and if you've begun taking Social Security benefits, you need to be aware of how your Social Security income may be taxed—and the earned income thresholds that determine the level of your taxes and any reductions in benefits. In an AARP survey, 37% of people indicated that they plan to work either full time or part time during retirement.<sup>1</sup> Why? In addition to the financial benefits, many older workers anticipate that working after retirement can add valuable structure to their day and provide the mental stimulation that comes from interacting with co-workers, clients, and other work associates.

Among those who plan to work in retirement out of financial necessity, a survey by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found 43% expected to use the money to cover essential expenses, 37% to pay for health care, and 20% to save more for retirement.<sup>2</sup>

Whatever your reason for considering working in retirement, it’s a good idea to know how doing so will affect your Social Security benefits and your tax bill. Here are the facts, plus some strategies to consider. Temporary benefit reductions for earned income The earliest age at which you are eligible to claim Social Security benefits is 62. If you claim your benefits and continue to work, there is an earnings test until you reach your full retirement age (FRA), 66–67, depending on the year you were born. If you have earned income in excess of $17,640 in 2019, your benefits will be reduced by $1 for every $2 of earned income over the $17,640 limit.

Note that ""earned"" income includes wages, net earnings from self-employment, bonuses, vacation pay, and commissions earned—because they are all based upon employment. Earned income does not include investment income, pension payments, government retirement income, military pension payments, or similar types of ""unearned"" income.

If you reach your FRA during 2019, the limit for earned income rises to $46,920 and the benefits reduction is $1 for every $3 earned over the limit until the month you reach your FRA. After that, your earned income is not subject to an earnings test or benefit reductions. For example, if your monthly benefit was $2,000, here is how much your benefit would be reduced for various levels of earned income at certain ages: Monthly benefit reduction by age and earned income levels |                                           **Earned income**                                           | **Younger than FRA** | **Year attaining FRA** | **FRA or older** |

| Analysis based on $2,000 in assumed monthly Social Security benefits. For illustrative purposes only. |                      |                        |                  | Once you reach your FRA, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will look at the number of months of Social Security benefits that you were reduced due to the earnings test. They add that number of months to the age when you started Social Security, resulting in a later (older) retirement age for their records, and a resulting higher benefit going forward. For example, if you retired at 62 and your FRA was 66, and the earnings test reduced your Social Security during those 4 years by 50%, then at FRA the SSA would add 50% of those 4 years to your original retirement age, resulting in a new retirement age for their records of 64, and a corresponding higher benefit going forward.<sup>3</sup> Income tax implications Social Security benefits are subject to federal income taxes above certain levels of ""combined income"" (also known as provisional income or modified adjusted gross income). Combined income generally consists, among other things, of your adjusted gross income (AGI), nontaxable interest, and one-half of your Social Security benefits. For individual filers with combined income below $25,000, none of your Social Security is taxed. For joint filers with combined income below $32,000, none of your Social Security is taxed. (See [Income Taxes And Your Social Security Benefit](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/taxes.html) for more information.)

For individual filers with combined income of $25,000 to $34,000, 50% of your Social Security benefit may be subject to federal income taxes. If your combined income exceeds $34,000, then up to 85% of your Social Security benefits could be taxed. For joint filers with combined incomes of $32,000 to $44,000, 50% of your Social Security benefit may be subject to federal income taxes. If your combined income exceeds $44,000, then up to 85% of your Social Security benefits could be taxed.

Regardless of your income level, no more than 85% of your Social Security benefits will ever be subject to federal taxation.

Additionally, 13 states also tax your Social Security benefits. The rules and exemptions vary widely across this group so it is wise to research the rules for your state or consult with a tax professional if this affects you.<sup>4</sup> Social Security and Medicare taxes In addition to federal and possibly state income taxes, you will pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on any wages earned in retirement. (Income from investments, pension benefits, and money withdrawn from an IRA or 401(k) are excluded.) There is no age limit on these withholdings, nor is there any exemption for any sort of Social Security benefits status.

The good news is that these earnings can also count toward the calculation of your benefits: Social Security monitors your earnings record each year and will increase your benefit, if appropriate, based on these additional earnings.

What if you are making much less in retirement than before? Could it hurt your benefits? The answer is no, because the benefit payment is still based on your 35 highest years of earnings. At worst, there would be no impact; at best, it could help if this replaces any of the lower 35 years. The big decision: When to claim Social Security When to claim Social Security benefits will be one of the most important decisions that you make regarding your retirement, along with how to take income from your various retirement accounts and how you will fund your health care needs in retirement. The following chart shows the difference for someone turning 62 in 2019. Let's assume their Social Security benefit at full retirement age of 66 plus 6 months is $2,000. The first set of numbers on the chart shows the benefit amounts they would receive by claiming at various ages. **Tip:** You should also be aware of a special rule for the first year of retirement. This rule allows you to get a full Social Security check for any whole month you’re retired, regardless of your yearly earnings. This helps people who retire in midyear or later who have already earned more than the annual earnings limit. Going back to work—meet James In our hypothetical example, James, age 64, retired at 62 from a plumbing supply company in the Chicago area, and claimed Social Security benefits as soon as he was eligible, at 62. James misses not having some structure in his day. He loves home improvement and helping people, so he found a job at a big box retailer. His wife, Arlene, age 61, is still working part time. Both have FRAs of age 66. 3 Social Security options for James to consider 1.  **Social Security do-overs** are allowed within 12 months of commencing benefit payments.<sup>6</sup> In James’s case, he missed this window for a do-over. You are allowed one lifetime do-over, or withdrawal of benefits, and you must repay all benefits received. If you were having your Medicare premiums deducted from your Social Security check, you'll need to repay those premiums, unless you decide to withdraw from Medicare coverage as well. If your spouse and children were collecting dependent benefits based on your earnings record, they must pay back these benefits and you must get their agreement in writing before you'll be allowed to withdraw your application. When you resume benefits at a later date, they will be at the starting amount for your age and earnings record at that new time.
2.  **Suspending your benefit** is allowed once you reach your FRA. James can do this when he turns 66 if he chooses. The advantage is that his benefit will be suspended at the level at the time of suspension, and it can now grow until he resumes taking it at any point up until age 70, when it reaches its maximum level. The advantage for James is the accrual of delayed retirement credits, which will result in a higher benefit level when he resumes his benefit.<sup>7</sup> Note that if you suspend your benefit, no one will be allowed to draw benefits off your work record while your benefits are suspended. (For example, spousal and minor-child benefits would also be suspended.)
3.  **Filing a restricted application.** In some cases, it may be to your benefit to file what's known as a ""restricted application."" This means filing for a spousal benefit while leaving your own benefit untouched to grow as late as age 70. You can only file a restricted application if 1) you were born before January 2, 1954, 2) you have reached FRA, and 3) your spouse has filed for their benefit.
    
    Since Arlene did not turn 62 prior to December 31, 2015, she would not be eligible to file a restricted application for a spousal benefit based upon James's earnings record once she reaches her FRA. Each situation is unique, so talk with a financial advisor to learn the strategy that may work for you. Benefits of working longer Working into retirement can help in your retirement planning, especially if your savings are running a bit behind your goals. Continuing to work allows you to keep building retirement savings. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you can contribute to a 401(k) or other tax-deferred workplace savings plan, a health savings account (HSA), and an IRA, even if you are collecting Social Security. You can also make catch-up contributions, which enable you to set aside larger amounts of money for retirement.

Social Security can form the bedrock of your retirement income plan. That's because your benefits are inflation-protected and will last for the rest of your life. Consider working with your Fidelity financial advisor to explore options on how and when to claim your benefits."

Get the truth behind these bits of financial misinformation. Myth \#1: It's not worth saving if I can only contribute a small amount. **In reality:** If you start early, around age 25, saving 15% of your paycheck—including your employer’s match to your 401(k) if you have one—could help you save enough to maintain your current way of life in retirement. It sounds like a lot, but don’t lose your motivation if you can’t save that much. Don't be discouraged if you start later than age 25. Beginning to save right now and gradually increasing the amount you're able to put away can help you hit your goals.

Save as much as you can while still being able to pay for essentials like rent, bills, and groceries. Fidelity's budgeting guidelines may be able to help determine how much you can afford to save and spend.

 *  Consider allocating no more than 50% of take-home pay to essential expenses (including housing, debt repayment, and health care).
 *  Try to save 15% of pre-tax income (including employer contributions) for retirement.
 *  Prepare for the unexpected by saving 5% of take-home pay in short-term savings for unplanned expenses. Myth \#2: The stock market is too risky for my retirement money. **In reality:** It’s true that money in a savings account is safe from the ups and downs of the stock market. But it won't grow much either, given that interest rates on savings accounts are typically low. When it’s time to withdraw that money for retirement a few decades from now, your money won’t buy as much because of inflation. The stock market, however, has a long history of growth, making it an important component of your longer-term investment portfolio.

For instance, for a young person investing for retirement, a diversified investment strategy based on your time horizon, financial situation, and risk tolerance could provide the level of growth you need to achieve your goals.

There are a variety of ways to invest. Building a diversified portfolio based on your needs and the length of time you plan to be invested can be as complicated or as simple as you prefer. You can build your own diversified portfolio with mutual funds or exchange-traded funds—or even individual securities.

Even if you choose to manage your own investments, you may not be entirely on your own. 401(k) providers often offer example investment strategies that could give you ideas on how to build a diversified portfolio. You can invest in the funds in the model portfolio in the suggested proportions or you could use the models as a source of inspiration for your own investment ideas

If you find investing daunting or don’t have the time to figure it out just yet, you might consider a [managed account](http://www.fidelity.com/managed-accounts/overview) or a [target-date fund](http://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/mutual-funds/single-fund-strategies) for savings that are earmarked for retirement. Myth \#3: I’m young, so I don’t need to save for retirement now. **In reality:** Retirement can feel very far away when you're young—but having all of those years to save can actually be incredibly powerful. That's because time and compounding are important factors in a retirement savings plan.

Compounding happens as you earn interest or dividends on your investments and reinvest those earnings. Because the value of your investments is then slightly higher, it earns even more interest, which is then packed back into the investments and it grows even more.

Over time, the value can snowball because more dollars are available to benefit from potential capital appreciation. But time is the secret ingredient—if you aren’t able to start saving early in your career you may have to save a lot more in order to make up for the value of lost time. You can start by contributing to your 401(k) or other workplace savings plan. If your employer matches your contributions, make sure you contribute up to the match—otherwise you’re basically giving up free money. If you don’t have a workplace retirement account, consider opening an IRA to get started.

But Fidelity did the math and came up with some guidelines. Aim to save at least 15% of your pretax income every year—including employer contributions. To see if you’re on track, use our savings factor: Aim to have saved at least 1x (times) your income at 30, 3x at 40, 7x at 55, and 10x at 67. Of course, everyone's situation is unique and you may find that you need to save more or less than this suggestion.

Read about all of Fidelity's retirement saving guidelines on Fidelity.com: [Retirement roadmap](http://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/retirement-roadmap)

Don’t worry if you’re not always on track. Saving consistently, increasing your contributions when you’re able, and investing for growth in a diversified mix of investments could help you catch up over time. Myth \#5: All debt is bad. **In reality:** It’s true that carrying a balance on your credit card or a high-interest loan can cost a lot—significantly more than the amount you initially borrowed. But not all debt will hold you back. In fact, certain types of debt, like mortgages and student loans, could help you move forward in life and achieve your personal goals.

Plus, the interest rates on mortgages and student loans are typically much lower than those on personal loans or credit cards, and the interest may be tax deductible.

No matter what kind of debt you take on, make sure you shop around for the best rates and never borrow more than you can afford to pay back on time. Myth \#6: Credit cards should be avoided. **In reality:** As long as you pay off your card balance in full each month to avoid interest, making purchases with credit can be worthwhile. Many credit cards offer a rewards program. If you make all your everyday purchases with your card, you could quickly rack up points you can redeem for cash, travel, electronics, or to invest.

Also, demonstrating that you use credit responsibly can help you increase your credit score, making it easier to buy a car or a home later on. It may even earn you a lower interest rate when you borrow in the future. It can be difficult to dig out of credit card debt, but if you control your spending and pay the card off every month, it could pay you back."

These days you're probably thinking about the beach, the mountains, or a road trip with the family. But summer, when life may be a little slower and your mind a little less cluttered, is actually a good time to do a quick midyear financial reality check.

A midyear checkup can accomplish several things. You can stop and think about your financial goals, such as saving for retirement, a house, a child's education, or a financial cushion, and then make sure that you are investing appropriately for those goals. And while you are looking at your accounts, take care of ""housekeeping"" items too, like checking beneficiaries, which isn't complicated but can have serious consequences if neglected.

Here are 5 things to do in a midyear review. 1. Review your financial goals You probably have several savings goals and accounts. Your annual financial review should revisit each of your priorities. If your situation has changed, make adjustments as necessary.

For instance, if you've been saving for a new home or your children's college education, you might want to adjust those goals based on the current real estate market and college tuition costs.

While you're reviewing your finances, it's a good idea to revisit the amount you're saving for retirement. See if you're saving enough already or if you could bump up your savings a bit.

At the same time, check the beneficiaries you've listed on your accounts, no matter what age you are. Your retirement account assets (for instance money in a 401(k) or IRA) pass directly to the beneficiaries you designate with your account custodian, trustee, or plan administrator. Your beneficiary designations supersede any directions in your will for your retirement account—so who you name as beneficiary is important.

You can also name beneficiaries on a regular bank or brokerage account.

**Tip:** [Find out how to update your beneficiaries](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/customer-service/how-to-update-account-beneficiaries) 2. Check your investments This is also the time to see what you own, ensure that your investment mix continues to meet your needs, and make any changes that might be necessary due to the past year’s market performance. Start by assessing your mix of stocks, bonds, and cash to see if it still matches your time frame for investing, risk tolerance, and financial situation. You may need to make changes if there have been any big life events since your last portfolio review. It's also a good idea to make sure your investments still align with your target investment mix. In general, if any of your allocations are more than 10% away from your target, you may want to rebalance it back to your desired investment mix. And if you don't have a target investment mix, you can create one in our [Planning & Guidance Center](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/calculators-tools/planning-guidance-center).

Then, look at specific investments and evaluate the role of each in your portfolio. If you own mutual funds, see whether they are performing as you expected and if there have been any changes to the fund's investment approach. If you own stock in individual companies, evaluate each company’s current status and prospects, and decide whether they justify keeping it in your portfolio. 3. Get a tax break A simple way to reduce your taxes is to take advantage of opportunities to lower your taxable income by contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. If you have a high deductible health plan (HDHP) eligible for a health savings account (HSA), contributing to the HSA can also give you a tax break. A taxpayer with a marginal tax rate of 24%, for example, could potentially realize a tax savings of $240 for every $1,000 in pre-tax dollars contributed to an HSA, traditional 401(k), 403(b), or IRA.

If you have an HDHP, it can be a good idea to contribute at least enough to your HSA to cover your anticipated health care expenses. If you’re not sure how much your health care expenses may be, it’s a good idea to put in at least enough to cover your deductible. You can always change the contribution amount later if you find you need to. HSA contributions are pre-tax and tax-deductible. When you use money saved in an HSA on qualified medical expenses now or in retirement, the withdrawals—of contributions and any investment returns—are tax-free.

If you have a retirement plan at work, make sure you’re contributing at least enough to get the entire match from your employer. If you can save more, contribute the maximum to your HSA. You can change your HSA contribution at any time. If your HSA is funded for the year and you’ve gotten your match, see if you can save more in your retirement account. For 2019, you can contribute $19,000 of pre-tax dollars to your 401(k) or 403(b). Also, those aged 50 and older may make a catch-up contribution of as much as $6,000, meaning they can contribute $25,000 in total.

Eligible taxpayers can contribute up to $6,000 (or up to the level of earned income, if lower) to a traditional or Roth IRA, or $7,000 if they have reached age 50, for 2019. Self-employed individuals with a simplified employee pension (SEP) plan can contribute 25% of their compensation, to a maximum of $56,000.

If you received a big tax refund or wrote a sizeable check for tax due with your 2018 return, or experienced any life changes, you should evaluate whether you’re having too much or too little in taxes withheld from your pay. The IRS withholding calculator can help you determine how much—if any—of an adjustment to make.

Now may be a good time to see how the new tax laws could impact you next year when you file 2019 taxes. Some tax breaks you got last year may be suspended or reduced in 2019. For instance, the state and local tax deduction is now capped at $10,000 for sales and state and local property taxes or sales and state and local income taxes.

The potential good news is that the standard deduction increased from $12,000 in 2018 to $12,200 for individuals in 2019. For married couples filing jointly, it's up from $24,000 in 2018 to $24,400 in 2019. 4. Protect what's yours It's wise to evaluate your insurance needs annually to make sure you have the right amount and type of insurance to cover unforeseen circumstances that can derail your finances.

Life insurance may be a good place to start. If your family is growing, you might want to increase the amount of your life insurance to protect your loved ones. Life insurance is mainly designed to replace lost income. As you get older, there are fewer years of income in the future, so the amount of income to replace decreases.

**Tip:** Estimate your insurance coverage needs with our [Term Life Insurance Needs Estimator](https://gpi.fidelity.com/ftgw/interfaces/tne/#/)

If you choose to reduce your life insurance, you could apply the savings toward your retiree health care savings—the cost of health care in retirement continues to increase so it can be a good idea to prepare specifically for those expenses. Fidelity estimates a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend, on average, $285,000 on out-of-pocket health care costs in retirement.<sup>1</sup> If you have an HSA, consider contributing money above and beyond the amount you need for the current year’s health care expenses. Saving and investing in an HSA for the long-term could help you pay for health care expenses in retirement.

You might also benefit from looking into long-term care insurance, which may offer a variety of features and options.

Don't forget disability insurance as well. You may be covered at work. But it’s a good idea to make sure you're adequately covered just in case anything prevents you from working and earning a paycheck for an extended period of time.

Check your insurance beneficiary designations. It's easy to do, but it could have a huge negative impact if it's neglected. For example, if you forget to change the beneficiary after a big life event like a divorce, insurance proceeds could go to the wrong person if anything were to happen to you. 5. Review important paperwork Thinking about a will, health care proxy, and power of attorney can be an uncomfortable topic, but consider the alternative. Do you want someone else making important financial and health decisions on your behalf without any input from you? If you don't have any of these key documents, take the time to set them up.

If you have them, review your paperwork and think about any life events you’ve been through. Marriage, divorce, birth, and death are the 4 big events that affect estate plans, but there are other factors that could affect your planning.

Make sure the people you care about know where to find relevant documents and information too. Consider using a secure virtual safe like [FidSafe<sup>®</sup>](https://www.fidsafe.com/)<sup>2</sup> to store copies of important documents and other information, such as passwords, financial statements, and wills. It's worth it While this might sound like a lot of ground to cover, a midyear checkup is well worth the effort when you consider the hard work you have invested in building and protecting your savings."

If the answer is when you first signed the stack of documents at your attorney’s office, then you’re not alone. Many of us complete an estate plan and then fail to revisit it for years (and some never do).

It is important, however, to review a plan every so often due to ever-changing tax laws and major life events, such as a birth, marriage, divorce, or death. At a minimum, you should consider dusting off and revisiting your estate plan every 3 to 5 years, to help ensure alignment with current laws.

Below is a list of 10 common pitfalls of an outdated estate plan. If any of these apply to you, it may be prudent to meet with your estate planning team to review and, perhaps, update your plan. 1. Fiduciary follies: When the wrong executor or trustee is named Do you know who your fiduciaries are? A fiduciary is someone who is appointed to take legal control over assets for the benefit of another person (the beneficiary). It is a fiduciary's legal responsibility to act in the beneficiary's best interest. Two types of fiduciaries often seen in estate plans are executors and trustees.

Executors are typically appointed in a will and are given control of assets during the probate process, until the assets are ultimately distributed to the named beneficiaries. Executors are responsible for collecting all the assets of the deceased, paying final debts, paying expenses, and filing any estate tax returns.

Trustees control the assets held within trusts, which may have been set up during a person's life, or at death under the terms of a will. While an executor's role is typically for a finite period, a trustee's role may continue either in perpetuity or until the trust is terminated. A key role of the trustee is to make distributions to a beneficiary while following the terms of the trust agreement. Executors and trustees generally bear responsibility for investments, accountings, and tax filings during their tenure.

Outdated estate plans often name fiduciaries or successor fiduciaries that may no longer be suited for the position. A fiduciary named years earlier may be too elderly, or even deceased. If a professional (e.g., attorney, CPA) is named, it is possible that they may no longer be practicing, or their professional relationship with the beneficiary may have since ended. Even named corporations, which we generally assume to exist in perpetuity, may have merged with or been acquired by another entity. And children who may have been too young to serve when the documents were created could now be capable of taking on the role of fiduciary.

Although fiduciaries are bound by certain standards of law, it is most important to name individuals you trust. Other important considerations are the age, maturity, and level of financial knowledge of the fiduciary. It is quite possible that the individuals who had fit most of these qualifications may have changed over the years and now no longer do.

Check to see who you have named as fiduciaries in your estate planning documents to determine whether you need to revisit these designations. 2. Your ""little ones"" aren't so little anymore When a child is young, a key estate planning decision parents often make is to determine a guardian. If your child is now an adult, however, a guardian may no longer be relevant, but new considerations arise: Is your child married? Is your child financially responsible? Are you leaving assets to your children in a trust? Have your children had children of their own?

Many trusts are designed to distribute assets to children at certain ages, e.g., one-third at age 25, one-half of the remaining assets at age 30, and the remaining balance at age 35. If a child is now above one or more of these ages, they will receive distribution of part or all of the trust assets outright and free of trust upon the last to die between you and your spouse. Now that your child is older, you may feel differently about their ability to handle a large inheritance; for example, you may feel that large sums might not be spent in the most prudent manner if they are free of restrictions. Further, if the child is married, an inheritance can easily be commingled with the spouse's assets, possibly subjecting the distributed trust assets to equitable distribution upon a divorce. An inheritance free of trust will also be subject to any existing or future creditor claims. These are some of the factors you may wish to consider when reviewing your estate plan to determine if it still meets your needs.

Furthermore, in many cases, outdated estate plans are simply not consistent with current wishes or circumstances. For example, it is possible that one child within a family has been financially successful while another has not. When an estate plan is initially created, an equal amount of inheritance among children may have been the goal, but that may have changed over time. Also, in some cases, beneficiaries named on retirement accounts and life insurance policies may not be in line with the trusts created for children under a will or revocable trust. It is vital to revisit all the ways assets are being left to children, given their current age and maturity, to make sure the plan still matches the current intent.

Lastly, when children are minors, they do not typically need health care powers of attorney, living wills, or advance health care directives, since their parents or guardians are legally responsible for them. But once they become adults, they should consider having these important documents in their own right.

Periodically review the ways that assets will be left to your children, and encourage them to have the appropriate estate planning documents in place as they get older and their circumstances change.

Privacy please: HIPAA rights and when they should be waived The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was passed in 1996, in part to establish national standards for protecting the confidentiality of every individual's medical records and other personal health information. As a general rule, health care powers of attorney, living wills, and advance health care directives should contain provisions waiving an individual’s HIPAA rights with respect to their health care representatives.

These stipulations allow physicians and other health care professionals to share a patient’s medical information with their representatives, empowering them to make informed health care decisions. Without these HIPAA authorizations in health care documents, doctors may be unwilling to share medical information, which may impede decision-making regarding a patient's care and any end-of-life wishes. These concerns would also apply to adult children who may have just graduated from high school or are attending college.

Take stock of your family's health care powers of attorney, living wills, and advanced health care directives, to ensure that health care representatives can make informed decisions regarding your family's care. 4. More money, more complexity: Wealth accumulation can create estate tax issues Financial security is a goal for us all, but with wealth comes complexity. An increase in wealth not only typically causes an increase in annual income taxes, but it may also beget estate and gift taxes. Current federal law allows each citizen to transfer a certain amount of assets free of federal estate and gift taxes, named the ""applicable exclusion amount.""

In 2019, every citizen may, at death, transfer assets valued in the aggregate of $11.4 million ($22.8 million for married couples), free from federal estate tax. For gifts made during one's lifetime, the applicable exclusion amount is the same. Therefore, every person is allowed to transfer a total of $11.4 million during their life or at death, without any federal estate and gift tax. (This does not include the annual gift exclusion, which applies as long as each annual gift to each recipient is less than $15,000.)

Therefore, generally, only estates worth more than these amounts at the time of death will be subject to federal estate taxes. But this wasn't always so. From 2001 to 2009, the applicable exclusion rose steadily, from $675,000 to $3.5 million. 2010 was a unique year, in that there was no estate tax, but it was brought back in 2011 and then made permanent (unless there is further legislation) by the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 at an exclusion amount of $5 million, indexed for inflation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017 doubled the exclusion amount to $10 million, indexed for inflation ($11.4 million for 2019). However, the new exclusion amount is temporary and is scheduled to revert back to the previous exclusion levels in 2026.

Outdated estate documents may include planning that was appropriate for estates at much lower exemption values. Many documents have formulas that force a trust to be funded up to this applicable exclusion amount, which may now be too large or unnecessary altogether, given an individual’s or family’s asset level.

Take the time to review the formulas in your estate documents with your attorney and tax professional to determine whether the planning you have in place is still appropriate. 5. Getting out of Dodge: Changes in state residency Where were you living when you drafted your most recent estate plan? Each state has its own estate and income tax laws, and it is important to plan appropriately. Furthermore, some states are common law property states and others are community property states. There are significant differences between them when it comes to transferring assets, and a document drafted in a common law property state might not be appropriate in a community property state.

As of 2019, 17 states and the District of Columbia\* also impose some form of estate or inheritance tax. Additionally, each state has different exemption amounts, so it is vital to evaluate your current wealth and estate planning needs with your attorney, keeping both the federal and your state's exemption amounts in mind.

In addition, for many married couples in a state that imposes a state estate tax, this may have the effect of requiring payment of state estate tax after the first death, when none had been anticipated. Prior to 2001, because the ""pick-up tax"" was imposed only on estates that had to pay federal estate tax, estates below a certain threshold did not have to worry about such a tax. The threshold was the amount of the federal applicable exclusion amount. That is no longer the case. The practical effect of the difference between a state's exemption amount and the federal applicable exclusion amount is that certain estates will now be subject to a state estate tax, despite the fact that the estate is exempt from federal estate tax. In some situations, establishing a trust as part of an estate plan can help counter state estate tax implications.

Review your estate plan with your attorney and tax professional, with an eye toward reducing federal and state estate taxes, and make sure to reevaluate and potentially update your plan to establish residency in another state. 6. Potent portability: Unused portion of exclusion amount may now be transferred to second spouse Portability rules allow a surviving spouse to take advantage of any unused portion of their spouse's applicable exclusion amount, provided that a federal estate tax return is filed to preserve the deceased spouse’s unused applicable exclusion amount within 9 months of their passing (15 months if an extension is granted).

Prior to portability, many estate plans included credit shelter trusts (CSTs). CSTs are sometimes referred to as bypass, family, or exemption trusts and are typically funded with assets having a value equal to the applicable exclusion amount ($11.4 million in 2019) of the first spouse to die. Assets placed in a CST can be excluded from the estate of the surviving spouse if the applicable exclusion amount of the first spouse to die is properly allocated to it. Prior to 2011, couples were required to use a CST to preserve the exclusion of the first spouse to die. With portability, this is no longer required. However, it should be noted that flexibility may be limited by the non-portability of the generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exemption and at least some state estate tax exemptions, which still limit the time period in which the exclusion may be allowed. Although there may still be other reasons to use a CST, you might consider reviewing your estate planning documents with your attorney to determine whether allowing more flexibility in the funding of a CST, or the use of portability, is appropriate in your current situation.

As an alternative, for many people, disclaimer trust provisions allowing for this flexibility may be more suitable, considering the allowance of portability. Disclaimer trusts differ from CSTs in that they are optional, and are activated only after the first spouse's death at the election of the surviving spouse, depending on their current situation. There is flexibility in this type of planning because if there is no tax reason to use credit shelter planning, the spouse can simply receive all or a portion of the assets outright. This allows tax-planning flexibility without creating unnecessary complication. In addition, disclaimer trusts may be a good way to help reduce state estate taxes (if your state imposes one) and may help address uncertainty over the size of the marital estate, or concerns that the exclusion amount may decline in the future.

Although recent law allows the portability of the deceased spouse's applicable exclusion amount, there is no portability of the deceased spouse's generation-skipping tax exemption amount. A GST is the transfer of property, directly or in trust, to an individual who is 2 or more generations below the transferor. The IRS taxes these transfers at a rate of 40%. However, the IRS does give an exemption amount for the first $11.4 million (similar to the applicable federal exclusion amount). If you wish to use GST planning for your children so that your assets can benefit them during their lifetimes and then pass to your grandchildren without incurring estate tax at that time, you must preserve the GST exemption.

Given changes to portability, it makes sense to review your estate plan with your attorney and tax professional to ensure that it is still structured in the most efficient way. 7. Don't stop giving: Fulfilling philanthropic goals For many, with success comes a desire to give back to the community or to causes they feel most passionate about. Individuals may contribute their time (volunteer work), talents (pro bono activities), or treasure (money or other assets). Many donate to religious organizations or to charities that support cancer research or that provide benefits to military veterans. Generally, people donate to charity because they care about these organizations, but they may also be seeking charitable deductions for income tax purposes. The bottom line is that philanthropy is positive for society, for the charity, and for donors' families.

Many of us, however, forget to include our important charitable causes in our estate plans, so our intentions are often not carried out after our deaths. Just like when we give to charity during our lives, there are many of the same benefits available when charitable giving is included in our wills. Everything from direct gifts to charities, to charitable trusts, to donor-advised funds, or to family foundations should be discussed and considered with your estate planning team. There are various ways to help you achieve your charitable goals while ultimately potentially reducing your estate taxes and increasing the amount you pass on to heirs.

Discuss your charitable intentions with your estate planning team to ensure that your philanthropic goals are included as part of your plan. 8. The lesser of 2 taxes: Income tax rates have increased relative to estate tax rates Your prior estate planning may have emphasized federal estate tax savings because of the much lower applicable exclusion amount and traditionally higher federal estate tax rates. Changes in the federal tax law make it increasingly important to focus on the income tax consequences of estate planning in addition to the estate tax consequences. For estates still subject to federal estate tax, the federal estate tax rate is 40%. These rates must be compared with the top federal income tax rates of 37% on ordinary income and 20% on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, plus a 3.8% Medicare net investment income tax.

Furthermore, trust income tax rates must be taken into consideration. Trusts are taxed at the highest federal income tax bracket at as low as $12,750 of income. Therefore, when transferring assets to a trust for estate planning purposes, consideration should be given to the potentially negative consequences of higher income taxes. Outdated estate plans may not provide the flexibility required to shift the income tax burden from the trust to individuals in potentially lower tax brackets.

Revisit your estate planning documents and gifting strategies with your attorney and tax professional to determine whether they are still appropriate, considering the Medicare net investment income tax, the current federal estate tax rate, and the increased applicable exclusion amount. 9. Make sure life insurance policies are not on life support Does your existing life insurance policy still make sense, both from an estate planning and a financial planning perspective? Is the policy performing as expected? Is the policy still competitive with what is available in the marketplace today? Do you own your policy outright or should it be owned by a trust? Many people purchase life insurance and continue paying the premiums for many years, even though their financial picture has changed dramatically.

Carefully review and assess the health of your life insurance and its ownership during your periodic estate plan review to make sure it is consistent with your financial and estate planning goals.

Help me help you: Talking with the next generation Do your loved ones know what you plan to leave to them when you die? Do they know who to contact when something happens? Fewer surprises will make estate administration much easier when the time comes.

Consider drafting and regularly updating a letter of instruction to your children and fiduciaries. This letter should include an inventory of assets, and a list containing names, addresses, and phone numbers of your estate planning team. Easy access to this information may save your family from headaches down the road. Furthermore, having a discussion regarding your assets, your intentions, and your reasoning (especially when creating trusts rather than leaving assets outright) will help build relationships and avoid family discord, and may even reduce the likelihood of litigation down the road. Additionally, make sure to give your fiduciaries the appropriate power to handle your assets. There has been a lot of change in recent years to laws regarding the administration of digital assets, such as email accounts, social media accounts, and song and picture libraries. You may want to create a list of your digital assets and name a successor to handle them. Proper documentation of succession planning for your digital assets is necessary because state and federal laws may prohibit others from accessing or using your digital assets without written consent. Conclusion Many estate plans no longer meet their original intent due to inattention and a lack of routine updating. Death, birth, marriage, divorce, and having children reach adulthood are some of the many reasons estate plans become outdated. Inevitable changes in laws and the tax code, not to mention changes to family and financial circumstances, further erode a plan’s effectiveness. Successful estate planning requires more than just having signed the initial documents: Your plan should evolve as your circumstances do."

 *  Use 2-factor authentication for all online financial accounts.
 *  Maintain updated industry-standard operating systems and software.
 *  Do not use public Wi-Fi for your finances or other sensitive items. You've likely spent a good deal of time thinking about investment risk. But have you stopped to think about more personal security issues, such as the safety of your online financial transactions and information stored on your computers? While most people recognize that online fraud or cybercrime is a potential threat, few know how or why they may be at risk. Cybercrime can take many forms, and understanding who the enemies are and how they commit crimes may allow you to better defend yourself. The ""Bad Guy"" Economic cybercriminals pose the greatest online risk to your family's personal financial data and assets. Make no mistake, many of these thieves are highly skilled and sophisticated. They may be individuals or coordinated groups that use technology to steal. For most of us, cybercrime can best be described as an extension of traditional criminal activity focused on personal financial data and monetary theft. How do cybercriminals operate? Indiscriminate targeting In some cases, cybercriminals cast a wide net with ""phishing"" scams, among others, and hope the sheer quantity of potential victims will yield sufficient economic benefit (see ""The making of a cybercrime,"" below, for more details on how cybercriminals attack). Specific victim targeting A growing and more concerning trend is the specific targeting of high-net-worth individuals. In many of these cases, criminals spend a great deal of time and effort identifying a worthwhile target and then developing a victim profile based on public and private information—such as property records, credit information obtained via hacking, and posted details on social networks&mdash;with the goal of stealing assets from financial accounts.

Although the actual criminal act can take several forms, the basic steps are often similar. Below is a relatively common scenario:

 *  **Step 1:** The thief sends an email with a link or attachment to the victim that appears to come from a known party. The targeted victim then clicks the link or attachment, which includes malicious software (malware) that infects the victim's computer.
 *  **Step 2:** The thief uses installed malware to steal login credentials to the victim's financial accounts. This will generally allow the thief to log in as the victim.
 *  **Step 3:** With access to accounts, the thief changes the victim's profile at the financial institution and/or impersonates the victim and moves money to criminal accounts at a different institution.

That's the bad news. The good news is that with some simple steps, you can improve your defenses and reduce your vulnerability to this type of crime. Steps you can take to help keep your online accounts safe 1. Use 2-factor authentication and strong passwords Treat your computing devices as you would your front door—restrict access and use tough security measures. Passwords are the keys to your online financial information. If cybercriminals find them, they can unlock the doors to your bank accounts, investment accounts, and your personal information. Unfortunately, a significant amount of malicious software trolls the internet looking specifically for account credentials (IDs and passwords). With an inadvertent click on what appears to be a legitimate link or the opening of an attachment designed to look legitimate, this software can be loaded on your machine and be ready to take your ""keys."" **Go for 2**
 Adding an additional layer of security when you access your accounts, called 2-factor authentication, is a strong defense against this type of attack. Fidelity and many other financial firms now offer 2-factor authentication. It requires you to enter a unique security code, randomly generated and sent to your phone or other mobile device, in addition to your standard login. While not completely foolproof, 2-factor authentication raises the bar for cyberattackers trying to access your accounts. You might also consider it for nonfinancial sites—Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all offer 2-step authentication options.

**Go long and stay strong**
 You've probably heard this before, but it bears repeating: Never use names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, or any personally identifiable letters or numbers as your password. Use a different password for every application and change them often. Why? The dangers of password reuse. Every year there are data breaches and more sets of credentials (user IDs and passwords) leaked onto the internet. It is common practice these days for criminals to collect these credential dumps and try these user IDs and passwords at financial sites, email providers, mobile phone providers, social media sites, and others. If a Fidelity customer were to use the same password here that they used on another account, and that other account was breached, their Fidelity account could be at risk.

What constitutes a good password? The most important factor is length (at least 12 to 14 characters is best), but complexity also makes passwords more unique. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters and stay away from dictionary words or common combinations of words. It's also best to avoid common substitutions within words, like replacing the letter ""o"" with a zero. It's just too obvious. A string of uncorrelated words with numbers and special characters is best. Importantly, when selecting a password, don't rely on free password strength checkers—they often miss the mark.

**Install a password manager**
 These days, most of us have dozens of passwords covering multiple devices and everything from social media to subscription services, e-commerce, banking, and Wi-Fi. Remembering all these passwords, and changing them frequently, just isn't sustainable. Fortunately, there's an app for that. Password manager apps generate and store all your passwords in a secure environment. They'll even auto-fill login information for stored sites. Many now sync your passwords across all your devices and automatically generate new ones on a regular schedule. The cost of state-of-the-art password managers is negligible—especially when compared with the convenience and security they provide. 2. Install industry-standard systems and software, keep them up to date, and perform regular backups One of the smartest things you can do to keep your financial information safe is to use modern, industry-standard operating systems and keep them up to date. Credible vendors have teams of cybersecurity specialists dedicated to fixing vulnerabilities in their current systems, and they are always on the lookout for new ways cybercriminals can hack into their products to access users' computer files or install malicious software. **Updating your systems is easier than it used to be**
Today, most operating systems let you set your update preferences to automatically install patches as soon as they are available. That goes for software too, including antivirus protection. Don't forget to update your mobile phones and tablets, and the apps installed on them. You can set update preferences to do this automatically, but many devices need to be plugged into your computer for a complete upgrade. It's a good idea to connect your mobile devices to your computer at least once a week so these updates can be downloaded and installed properly.

**You can never have too much backup**
Backing up your data is good system hygiene. It prevents your information from being lost forever and immunizes you from ransomware attacks. In this increasingly common scheme, criminals lure you into clicking an email link that downloads malware and blocks your access to the computer. The perpetrators can hold your hard drive hostage, demanding a hefty ransom to unblock it. If your system data is backed up elsewhere, it eliminates any leverage the scammers have, neutralizing their threats.

Backups are most effective when done in a continuous, real-time environment. Savvy users employ redundant methods—typically a USB-connected external storage device in tandem with an encrypted cloud-based service. External storage offers more immediate data retrieval, while cloud-based services can store much more data. Also, in the event of a flood or fire, both the computer and external storage device may be lost, but offsite backups to a cloud-based service would be safe.

Don't forget to include mobile devices in regular backups. This can be done via a cloud-based service, but a full backup may require connecting to a computer. By syncing up your photos and home movies to your computer, they will then be included in regularly scheduled backups, keeping them secure. 3. Use caution when linking to financial accounts or e-commerce sites through email Cybercriminals are getting smarter about making their phishy emails look legitimate. These emails mimic those of financial institutions, complete with logos and convincing signature lines. Searching Google and social media sites makes it easy to personalize these emails with your name and subject lines like ""Your recent transaction with us."" All of this is designed to lower your guard so you'll be more apt to click a link to a fraudulent version of your provider's website. This allows the scammers to download malicious software onto your computer or gain access to your passwords and usernames.

**The best offense is a good defense**
 Use caution when linking to your financial institution via email. Instead, go directly to your provider's website by using a link you've saved in your ""Favorites"" menu. That way, you'll be sure you arrive at a legitimate website. Always look for the ""https"" prefix in the site's address. This indicates that the connection to the site is encrypted to protect your sensitive data from prying eyes. 4. Always access your accounts from a secure Wi-Fi location Your home Wi-Fi network comes with built-in security, but it's not foolproof. Your network provider supplies you with a router ID and password, but these are default settings. Cybercriminals know the defaults for major network providers. If you're using these settings, your ""secure"" home Wi-Fi network may not be as secure as you think.

Home networks now connect computers and smartphones to thermostats, TVs, refrigerators, and residential security systems. Each device is a potential weak spot in your Wi-Fi network. As your home becomes more dependent on the internet, so does your exposure to a network breach.

When setting up your home network, consider changing the default network ID and passwords. Consider installing an Intrusion Detection or Intrusion Prevention system, as well as an applications-based firewall, to further secure your network.

**Beware of public Wi-Fi**
 Everyone loves free Wi-Fi, but unsecured public wireless access points are easy to intercept, providing an opportunity for attackers to snoop on your online activity. A safer alternative is to use only secure Wi-Fi networks. If you use your laptop or mobile devices while traveling, purchase a subscription to a paid hotspot provider in which the networks are password protected and have additional levels of security. 5. Consider using a dedicated device for online banking One of the best ways to secure your online financial information is to dedicate one device exclusively for banking and financial use. Many cyberattacks come from malware installed while you're web surfing and reading emails. Eliminating those activities from a dedicated banking computer goes a long way toward keeping your financial information out of harm's way.

**Help us help you**
A dedicated banking device also helps financial institutions keep your accounts secure. Most, including Fidelity, monitor client accounts for fraudulent logins from unauthorized computers and will alert you if there is suspicious activity in your account. When Fidelity surveyed client login patterns, we found many users logging in from multiple devices. One or two were common, but some clients routinely logged in from a seemingly random assortment of systems, making it difficult for an institution to distinguish a legitimate login from a fraudulent one. By using one device for all transactions, an illegitimate login stands out, and the institution will be able to move quickly to alert you and secure your account. 6. Understand your computing environment and consider whether you need help If you have a complex computing environment, a comprehensive cyber-risk assessment may be an appropriate step in protecting your personal information. Individuals with complicated online footprints may want to consider implementing additional systems (e.g., intrusion prevention and detection, firewalls).

Because cyber threats evolve almost as fast as technology itself, consider retaining a firm to provide ongoing system surveillance, support, and maintenance. These services include everything from monitoring your home internet traffic and blocking outside threats, to educating family members about smart social media practices, safe web surfing and e-commerce protocols.

A good risk assessment will be specific to each person and should consider questions like:

 *  How many computers, mobile devices, tablets, TVs, home security systems, and appliances are connected to your home Wi-Fi network?
 *  Are they shared across personal and home office use?
 *  Do non-family members regularly in your home have access to your Wi-Fi network or computing devices?
 *  What backup procedures are in place for each device?
 *  Are you or other household members active on social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest? Conclusion No one wants to spend time thinking about all the bad things that can happen, but it's important to understand potential threats to your assets and take measures to eliminate them. When it comes to protecting your financial accounts from cyberthreats, practicing good system hygiene and making a few changes in your user habits will significantly improve your online security. Clients can play a key role in helping Fidelity detect fraud. They can help us help them by maintaining a general awareness of their accounts, including staying alert to emails regarding password resets and account changes, and periodically logging in and checking for unusual transactions and activity.

Fidelity uses sophisticated security measures to protect our customers. We also make many additional security tools available for customers to utilize, including 2-factor authentication and transaction alerts. Of course, we also provide a Customer Protection Guarantee for fraudulent activity.

 *  Health care continues to be one of the largest expenses in retirement.
 *  To help fill a gap in saving for health care expenses, consider increasing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, especially HSAs (if you have one), which enable tax-free spending on health care in retirement.\*
    
    
    
    \*HSA contributions, earnings, and distributions used to pay for qualified medical expenses are tax-free for federal income tax purposes. If you are like most Americans, health care is expected to be one of your largest expenses in retirement, after housing and transportation costs. But unlike your parents' generation, you won't likely have access to employer- or union-sponsored retiree health benefits. So, health care costs will likely consume a larger portion of your retirement budget—and you need to plan for that.

There are a number of drivers behind this mounting retirement health care cost challenge. In general, people are living longer, health care inflation continues to outpace the rate of general inflation, and the average retirement age is 62 for most Americans—that's 3 years before you are eligible to enroll in Medicare.

""Health care is creating a 'retirement cost gap' for many pre-retirees,"" says Steve Feinschreiber, senior vice president of the Financial Solutions Group at Fidelity. ""Many people assume Medicare will cover all your health care cost in retirement, but it doesn't. We estimate that about 15% of the average retiree's annual expenses will be used for health care-related expenses,<sup>2</sup> including Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. So, you should carefully weigh all options."" Health care: What's your price tag? How much should you plan to pay in health care costs after you retire? According to the Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate,<sup>2</sup> an average retired couple age 65 in 2019 may need approximately $285,000 saved (after tax) to cover health care expenses in retirement. Of course, the amount you’ll need will depend on when and where you retire, how healthy you are, and how long you live. The amount you need will also depend on which accounts you use to pay for health care—e.g., 401(k), HSA, IRA, or taxable accounts; your tax rates in retirement (see chart below); and potentially even your gross income.<sup>3</sup>

**Tip:** If you're still working and your employer offers an HSA-eligible health plan, consider enrolling and contributing to a health savings account (HSA). An HSA can help you save tax-efficiently for health care costs in retirement. You can save pretax dollars (and possibly collect employer contributions), which have the potential to grow and be withdrawn tax-free for federal and state tax purposes if used for qualified medical expenses.<sup>4</sup>

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [5 ways HSAs can fortify your retirement](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/wealth-management/hsas-and-your-retirement) Pre- and early retirees: Make the most of your time to prepare As retirement nears, you will have several big decisions to make, including when to stop working, when to take Social Security, how to pay for health care, and how to generate cash flow from your retirement assets. These decisions are interconnected and could make a difference in your living costs and lifestyle in retirement—and when you can retire.

Some one third of ""early retirees"" who claim Social Security at age 62<sup>5</sup> do so to help pay for health care expenses until they are eligible for Medicare coverage at age 65. But if you can postpone retirement or save enough to cover health care costs until 65, then you may be able to defer your Social Security benefits. Generally speaking, the longer you can wait until age 70 to take Social Security benefits, the more you can collect, assuming you live a long life.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Should you take Social Security at 62?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/social-security-at-62)

If you're like most people, you probably don't have access to employer-sponsored pre-65 retiree medical coverage. So if you retire prior to age 65, you'll need to find coverage until you are eligible for Medicare. Consider these options that may be available to you (see table below).

When you do become eligible at age 65, you'll want to remember to sign up during your 7-month initial enrollment period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65.

There's a lot to learn about the world of Medicare. You'll need to know about Medicare Parts A, B, and D, as well as Medicare Advantage and ""Medigap"" supplemental insurance plans.

In brief:

 *  Part A covers hospital costs after you meet a deductible.
 *  Part B is optional coverage for medical expenses and requires an annual premium. Part D is for prescription drug coverage.
 *  Medicare Advantage plans are all-in-one managed care plans that provide the services covered under Part A and Part B of Medicare and may also cover other services that are not covered under Parts A and B, including Part D prescription drug coverage.
 *  Supplemental policies, referred to as Medigap policies, are offered by private insurance companies to supplement expenses that Medicare Parts A and B do not typically cover.

**Tip:** You may be better off paying a higher premium but not having to pay out-of-pocket at your office visits. Look at the cost of annual premiums and copays at different levels of supplemental insurance. Compare these costs. Then factor in the number of visits and copay/coinsurance per visit that you anticipate for the next year.

Once you select a Medicare plan, it's not forever. You can switch Medicare plans as you age and as your situation changes. Generally, it makes sense to enroll in Medicare Parts A, B, and D when you are first eligible because the late enrollment penalty for doing so later is steep (see next section if you are continuing to work after age 65). Turning 65 and still gainfully employed (or your spouse/partner is) If you're still working when you're 65 and get health insurance through your employer or your spouse's employer, you'll have the opportunity to enroll in Medicare when you leave your employer plan through a Special Enrollment Period.

In addition to Medicare options to consider, if your spouse or partner continues to work, they may be able to cover you through their health plan. Talk to your HR department to help you evaluate all your options, costs, and any restrictions. The rules of Medicare are complicated, so to get started, consider the following questions:

 *  Which plan offers you the best coverage for your health needs?
 *  Your employer is required to offer you coverage, but is that your best option?
 *  Is it more expensive to stay in your employer plan or join Medicare?
 *  Can your spouse or partner remain in your employer's plan if you decide to leave?

**Tip:** Remember, one of the key goals at this stage is to avoid any gap in coverage.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [6 key Medicare questions](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/understanding-medicare-options) and [Medigap 101](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/medigap-what-you-need-to-know) Health care in retirement: Costs can come later As you plan for health care expenses throughout your retirement—however long it may be—understand how paying for future health care expenses fits into your overall retirement income planning efforts, because health care utilization tends to increase as we age.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of household budgets spent on health expenses is nearly 3 times as much for retirees on Medicare as for working households (14% versus 5%).<sup>6</sup>

""Although health care costs continue to rise, there are financial planning steps that you can take today to help prevent health care costs from eating into your retirement lifestyle,"" Feinschreiber advises. ""For example, if you're age 50 or older, you may be able to make up for a savings shortfall with additional catch-up contributions to your 401(k) or IRA. In addition, if you are age 55 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution annually to your health savings account.""

 *  Get tax benefits.
 *  The earlier you start contributing, the more opportunity you have to build wealth. It can pay to save in an IRA when you're trying to accumulate enough money for retirement. There are tax benefits, and your money has a chance to grow. The deadline for a 2018 traditional or Roth IRA contribution is the same as the 2018 tax-filing deadline—April 15, 2019. Residents of Massachusetts and Maine have until April 17, 2019 because of local holidays. Time is running out to contribute for the 2018 tax year.

Why an IRA? An IRA is one of several tax-advantaged options for saving. If you have a retirement plan at work, an IRA could offer another tax-advantaged place to save.

If your employer doesn't offer a retirement plan—or you're self-employed—an IRA may make sense.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [No 401(k)? How to save for retirement](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/no-401k). Here are some reasons to make a contribution now 1. Put your money to work Eligible taxpayers can contribute up to $5,500 per year to a traditional or Roth IRA, or $6,500 if they have reached age 50, for 2018 (assuming they have earned income at least equal to their contribution). It's a significant amount of money—think about how much it could grow over time. For 2019 the limits increase to $6,000 and $7,000 for those age 50 and over.

Consider this: If you're age 35 and invest $5,500, the maximum annual contribution in 2018, that 1 contribution could grow to $82,360 after 40 years. If you’re age 50 or older, you can contribute $6,500, which could grow to about $17,900 in 15 years.<sup>1</sup> (We used a 7% long-term compounded annual hypothetical rate of return and assumed the money stays invested the entire time.)

The age you start investing in an IRA matters: It's never too late, but earlier is better. That’s because time is an important factor when it comes to compound growth. Compounding is what happens when an investment earns a return, and then the gains on the initial investment are reinvested and begin to earn returns of their own. The chart below shows just that. Even if you start saving early and then stop after 10 years, you may still have more money than if you started later and contributed the same amount each year for many more years. 2. You don't have to wait until you have the full contribution The $5,500 IRA contribution limit is a significant sum of money, particularly for young people trying to save for the first time.

The good news is that you don't have to put the full $5,500 into the account all at once. You can automate your IRA contributions and have money deposited to your IRA weekly, biweekly, or monthly—or on whatever schedule works for you.

Making many small contributions to the account may be easier than doing one big one. 3. Get a tax break IRAs offer some appealing tax advantages. There are 2 types of IRAs, the traditional and the Roth, and they each have distinct tax advantages and eligibility rules.

Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible for the year the contribution is made. Your income does not affect how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA—up to the annual contribution limit. But the deductibility of that contribution is based on income limits. If neither you nor your spouse are eligible to participate in a workplace savings plan like a 401(k) or 403(b), then you can deduct the full contribution amount, no matter what your income is. But if one or both of you do have access to one of those types of retirement plans, then deductibility is phased out at higher incomes.<sup>2</sup> Earnings on the investments in your account can grow tax-deferred. Taxes are then paid when withdrawals are taken from the account—typically in retirement. Just remember that you can defer but not escape taxes with a traditional IRA: Starting at age 70½, required minimum withdrawals become mandatory, and these are taxable (except for the part—if any—of those distributions that consist of non deductible contributions).

On the other hand, you make contributions to a Roth IRA with after-tax money, so there are no tax deductions allowed on your income taxes. Contributions to a Roth IRA are subject to income limits.<sup>3</sup> Earnings can grow tax-free, and, in retirement, qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are also tax-free. Plus, there are no mandatory withdrawals during the lifetime of the original owner.<sup>4</sup>

As long as you are eligible, you can contribute to either a traditional or a Roth IRA, or both. However, your total annual contribution amount across all IRA accounts is still $5,500 (or $6,500 if age 50 or older).

What's the right choice for you? For many people, the answer comes down to this question: Do you think you'll be better off paying taxes now or later? If, like many young people, you think your tax rate is lower now than it will be in retirement, a Roth IRA may make sense.

You may think you can't have an IRA, but make sure There are some common myths about IRAs—especially about who can and who can't contribute.

**Myth:** I need to have a job to contribute to an IRA.

**Reality:** Not necessarily. A spouse with no earned income can contribute to a spousal Roth or traditional IRA as long as their spouse has earned income. Note, however, that all other IRA limits and rules still apply.

**Myth:** I have a 401(k) or a 403(b) at work, so I cannot have an IRA.

**Reality:** You can, with some caveats—as mentioned earlier. For instance, if you or your spouse contributes to a retirement plan—like a 401(k) or 403(b)—at work, your traditional IRA contribution may not be deductible, depending on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI).<sup>2</sup> But you can still make a nondeductible, after-tax contribution and reap the potential rewards of tax-deferred growth within the account. You can contribute to a Roth IRA, whether or not you have contributed to your workplace retirement account, as long as you meet the income eligibility requirements.<sup>3</sup>

**Myth:** Children cannot have an IRA.

**Reality:** An adult can open a custodial Roth IRA (also known as a [Roth IRA for Kids](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/retirement-ira/roth-ira-kids)) for a child under the age of 18 who has earned income, including earnings from typical kid jobs such as babysitting or mowing lawns, as long as this income is reported to the IRS.<sup>5</sup>

An adult needs to open and maintain control of the account. When the child reaches the age of majority, which varies by state, the account's ownership switches from the parent over to them. Make a contribution Your situation dictates your choices. But one thing applies to all: the power of contributing early. Pick your IRA and get your contribution in and invested as soon as possible to take advantage of the tax-free compounding power of IRAs."
32,4126,Considerations for an old 401(k),['Saving for Retirement'],"['401(k)', 'IRA', 'Retirement Accounts', 'Rollover IRA']","['Investing strategies', 'Required minimum distributions', 'Retirement', 'Taxes', 'Work']","['401(k)', '403(b)', 'IRA', 'RMD Calculator', 'Retirement accounts', 'Rollover IRA']",Considerations for an old 401(k),Rollover options for an old 401(k),Rolling over a 401(k)?,Here are 4 options for a 401(k) with a former employer.,There are 4 options for a 401(k) with a former employer.,There are 4 options for a 401(k) with a former employer. Learn how to find the right one for you.," Key takeaways  *  4 options for an old 401(k): Keep it with your old employer, roll over the money into an IRA, roll over into a new employer's plan, or cash out.
 *  Make an informed decision: Find out your 401(k) rules, compare fees and expenses, and consider any potential tax impact. Changing or leaving a job can be an emotional time. You're probably excited about a new opportunity—and nervous too. And if you're retiring, the same can be said. As you say goodbye to your workplace, don’t forget about your 401(k) or 403(b) with that employer. You have several options and it’s an important decision.

Because your 401(k) may be a big chunk of your retirement savings, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of your options and find the one that makes sense for you.

Here are 4 choices to consider. 1. Keep your 401(k) with your former employer Most companies—but not all—allow you to keep your retirement savings in their plans after you leave. Some benefits:  *  Your money has the chance to continue to grow tax-deferred.
 *  You can take penalty-free withdrawals if you leave your job at age 55 or older.
 *  Many offer institutionally priced (i.e., lower-cost) or unique investment options.
 *  Federal law provides broad protection against creditors. But:  *  If you have less than $5,000 in the plan, the money may be automatically sent to you (or sent to an IRA for you).
 *  If you choose to keep the money in your former employer's plan, you won't be able to add any more money to the account, or, in most cases, take a 401(k) loan.
 *  Withdrawal options may be limited. For instance, you may not be able to take a partial withdrawal; you may have to take the entire balance.
 *  After you reach age 70½, you'll have to take annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k).

If you hold appreciated company stock in your workplace savings account, consider the potential impact of net unrealized appreciation (NUA) before choosing between a rollover or an alternative.

Roll over the money into an IRA You can open the IRA with a bank or brokerage firm.. Make sure to research fees and expenses when choosing an IRA provider, though. They can really vary. Some benefits:  *  Your money has the chance to continue to grow tax-deferred.
 *  If you're under age 59½, you can withdraw money penalty-free for a qualifying first-time home purchase or higher education expenses.<sup>2</sup>
 *  You may be able to get a broader range of investment choices than is available in an employer's plan. But:  *  After you reach age 70½, you’ll have to take annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional IRA (but not a Roth IRA<sup>1</sup>) every year, even if you're still working.
 *  Federal law offers more protection for money in 401(k) plans than in IRAs. However, some states offer certain creditor protection for IRAs too. 3. Roll over your 401(k) into a new employer's plan Not all employers will accept a rollover from a previous employer’s plan, so check with your new employer before making any decisions. Some benefits:  *  Your money has the chance to continue to grow tax-deferred.
 *  Having only one 401(k) can make it easier to manage your retirement savings.
 *  Many plans offer lower-cost or plan-specific investment options.
 *  Federal law provides broad protection against creditors. You can defer RMDs even if you're still working after age 70½.<sup>3</sup> But:  *  Make sure to understand your new plan rules.
 *  Consider the range of investment options available in the new plan. 4. Cash out Taking the money out of retirement accounts altogether should be avoided unless the immediate need for cash is critical and you have no other options. The consequences vary depending on your age and tax situation. If you withdraw from your 401(k) before age 59½, the money will generally be subject to both ordinary income taxes and a potential 10% early withdrawal penalty. (An early withdrawal penalty doesn't apply if you stopped working for your former employer in or after the year you reached age 55, but are not yet age 59½. This exception doesn’t apply to assets rolled over to an IRA.) If you are under age 59½ and absolutely must access the money, you may want to consider withdrawing only what you need until you can find other sources of cash. Obviously that's only possible if your former employer allows partial withdrawals—or if you roll the account into an IRA. How the rollover is done is important too Whether you pick an IRA for your rollover or choose to go with your new employer's plan, consider a direct rollover—that’s when one financial institution sends a check directly to the other financial institution. The check would be made out to the bank or brokerage firm with instructions to roll the money into your IRA or 401(k).

The alternative, having a check made payable to you, is not a good option in this case. If the check is made payable directly to you, your employer is required by the IRS to withhold 20% for taxes. As if that wouldn't be bad enough—you only have 60 days from the time of a withdrawal to put the money back into a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k) or IRA. That means if you want the full value of your former account to stay in the tax-advantaged confines of a retirement account, you'd have to come up with the 20% that was withheld and put it into your new account.

If you're not able to make up the 20%, not only will you lose the potential tax-free or tax-deferred growth on that money but you may also owe a 10% penalty if you're under age 59½ because the IRS would consider the tax withholding an early withdrawal from your account. So, to make a long story short, do pay attention to the details when rolling over your 401(k). Make the best decision for you When it comes to deciding what to do with an old 401(k), there may be factors that could be unique to your situation. That means the best choice will be different for everyone. One thing to remember is that the rules among retirement plans vary so it's important to find out the rules your former employer has as well as the rules at your new employer.

Do also compare the fees and expenses associated with the accounts you're considering. If you find it confusing or overwhelming, speak with a financial professional to help with the decision."

That is a myth: 62 is the earliest age you can claim your benefit, but it’s not the only age.
 *  Waiting to claim Social Security until after your full retirement age (FRA) comes with a bonus: 8% additional monthly income per each year you wait.
 *  Your ex-spouse has no influence over your benefits.
 *  If you were married for 10 consecutive years and have not remarried, you are entitled to either your own benefit—or 50% of your ex’s Social Security benefit, whichever is higher—once you reach your FRA. Getting your arms around Social Security can be pretty complicated. Misinformation, partially informed opinions, and complex benefits formulas can easily lead one down an incorrect—and costly—path. That's why it is important to work with your financial advisor to develop a Social Security claiming strategy that can serve as the foundation of your overall retirement income plan.

Before you make your decision about claiming this valuable benefit, let's clear up 5 of the most common myths and misperceptions about Social Security that could undermine your ability to generate the income you’ll need in retirement to live the life you want. Myth \#1: You must claim your Social Security benefit at age 62 Many people are adamant that Social Security benefits must begin at age 62. This is a myth: 62 is the earliest age you can claim your benefit, but it's not the only age.

Your base benefit is calculated based on your ""full retirement age,"" or FRA. Your date of birth determines your FRA. Your base benefit is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on your average indexed monthly earnings during the 35 years in which you earned the most (only the years that you paid Social Security taxes).

**Tip:** You'll find your FRA at Social Security's website, [SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/retirechart.html), or on a paper statement mailed to you by the Social Security Administration. For those born between 1943 and 1954, your FRA is 66. Those born later have an FRA of 66 (plus some months) or an FRA of age 67.

If you claim any time before your FRA, you lock in a permanent reduction in monthly income. Claiming at 62 translates to a reduced monthly income of 25% to 30%, depending on your FRA. That means you may receive a lot less monthly retirement income, every year, for potentially several decades. You might think you are not going to live a long life, but many people do: For people age 65 today, 25% of men will live until 93; 25% of women will live to 95.<sup>1</sup> A key consideration for when you claim Social Security is maximizing your income for a retirement that could last longer than 30 years.

**Wait until age 70 and lock in a ""bonus"":**

 *  Waiting to claim Social Security until after your FRA comes with a hefty bonus: 8% additional monthly income per each year you wait.
 *  If your FRA is 66, your monthly income would increase 32% by waiting.
 *  If your FRA is 66 years and 6 months (if you turn 62 in 2019), your monthly income would increase 28% by waiting.
 *  If your FRA is 67, your monthly income would increase by 24% waiting.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Longevity and retirement](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/longevity) Myth \#2: You'll never get back all the money you put into the program Although 70% of the respondents from our survey<sup>2</sup> thought they might not get back all the money they put in, many will. Everyone’s situation is different. Simply put, if you live a long time, you may collect more than you contributed to the system.

Due to the complexity of claiming strategies and number of variables involved, the Social Security Administration no longer offers a break-even calculator on its website. Social Security is designed to provide a safety net of income for the retired, the disabled, and survivors of deceased insured workers. The contributions you and your employers make during your working years provide:

1.  Current retirees and other Social Security recipients with payments
2.  A guaranteed income benefit when you reach retirement

While the government does not have a specific account set aside just for you with your FICA contributions (the taxes for Social Security and Medicare paid by you and your employer), one of the most powerful features of Social Security is that it provides an inflation-protected guaranteed income stream in retirement, ensuring against the risk you will outlive your savings. Even if you live to 100 or more, you continue to receive income every month. And, if you predecease your spouse, your spouse also receives survivor benefits until their death. Myth \#3: My ex-spouse's actions could negatively impact my Social Security benefit In a survey,<sup>3</sup> Fidelity asked more than 1,000 people if an ex-spouse could influence their Social Security benefits—52% of them said yes, this is true.

*The real answer: False.*

There are a lot of things an ex-spouse might do to complicate your life, but Social Security is off limits. Your ex has no influence over your benefits. If you have an ex-spouse, you may be entitled to spousal benefits as if you had remained married. If you were married for 10 consecutive years and have not remarried, you are entitled to either your own benefit—or 50% of your ex's Social Security benefit, whichever is higher—once you reach your FRA.

If you wish to claim on your ex-spouse's benefit, you simply make an appointment with your local SSA office and bring documents that prove the marriage and divorce. They will calculate your benefit options, and when you submit your claim, you’ll receive the higher benefit.

**Tip:** There's no need to discuss this with your ex-spouse, and your claim does not reduce or affect your ex's benefit in any way. It's your benefit, even if you've been divorced for many years. And, it may be larger than your own individual benefit. Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Unraveling Social Security rules for ex-spouses](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/social-security-for-divorced-spouses) Myth \#4: Your benefits are only based on wages that you've earned before age 65 How your Social Security benefit is calculated can seem mysterious. However, it’s important to know a few essential facts to aid your claiming strategy. You can use the tools on [SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/calculators/) to do the calculations.

 *  Your benefit is calculated based on your highest 35 years of earnings; they do not have to be consecutive years or before age 65.
 *  If you work past age 65, those earning years will be included, so long as they are high enough to be part of your highest 35 years.
 *  Even working part-time after turning 65 may be part of your highest 35 years of earnings.
 *  To be eligible for Social Security, you must have a minimum of 10 years of covered employment, which equates to 40 credits in the Social Security system.
 *  If you don’t have 35 years with earnings, zeros will be included in the calculation.

They've heard they can claim early at 62, then when they reach 66 or older, their checks will increase to the amount that corresponds to their full retirement age benefit. That's a big misperception.

There is no bumping up of income once you've claimed your Social Security retirement benefit. However, anyone receiving a benefit can voluntarily ""suspend"" that benefit after they reach FRA and resume it as late as age 70. If they do, the annual benefit will increase by 8% until age 70. After that, you get an annual cost of living adjustment, but no increase in your base benefit, which will start automatically the month you reach age 70 unless you specify otherwise.

In general, you can cancel your Social Security claim if you do so within the first 12 months of receiving benefits.<sup>2</sup> You must repay the full amount you've received, and the full amount a current spouse or family member received based on your benefit. Then, you are eligible to claim again at a later date and will receive a larger monthly payment. Each individual can only cancel a claim once in their lifetime.

**Case Study: Lower-income spouses may get a ""top up"" or ""auxiliary"" benefit.**

There is, however, one case where you could get a ""top up"" benefit at FRA, but you still need to wait until your FRA to claim your Social Security benefit. In this hypothetical example, Sally earned less during her career than her husband Brad. Her FRA benefit is $700 per month; his is $2,000. As a spouse, she's entitled to 50% of Brad's benefit if she claims at her FRA. She would receive a ""top up"" of $300 to bring her benefit up to the $1,000 (half of Brad's benefit) to which she is entitled. Social Security will calculate her options and pay out the higher benefit to which she is entitled. Social Security: Your contributions vs. potential benefits Let's look at a hypothetical case of Steve, who reached his FRA in 2018. He retired in December 2018 and began collecting his Social Security benefit in January 2019 at his FRA. In Steve's case, if he lives past age 76½, he will receive a larger benefit than he contributed to the system. There is no standard break-even point, but let's look at Steve's situation in more detail. Checklist for your Social Security claiming strategy  *  **Know your numbers.** Find out your FRA, earnings history, and estimated benefits.
 *  **Stay current.** Sign up for your most current statements on [SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/).
 *  **Do the math.** Use calculators on [SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/calculators/) to check out your monthly benefit options.
 *  **Get the facts.** Don't succumb to myths; use primary resources such as [SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/). Start planning early Claiming Social Security is an important part of your retirement income plan, but it takes some time to understand the options—and the implications to your savings. Social Security can form the bedrock of your retirement income plan. That's because your benefits are inflation-protected and will last for the rest of your life. Consider working with your Fidelity financial advisor to explore options on how and when to claim your benefits."

Here's what we've seen work for investors over the years.,Good news: It's actually pretty simple. Here's what we've seen work for investors over the years.," The power of investing to build wealth and achieve long-term goals has been proven time and again. But not everyone takes full advantage. What separates the most successful investors from the rest?

Here are the 6 habits of successful investors that we've witnessed over the years—and how to make them work for you. Develop a long-term plan—and stick with it Tall tales about the lucky investor who hit it big with a stock idea may be entertaining. But for most people, investing isn't about getting rich quick, or even making as much money as possible. It’s about reaching their goals—be they owning a home, sending a kid to college, or having the retirement they have long imagined.

Successful investors know that this means developing a plan—and sticking with it. Why does planning matter? Because it works.

A Fidelity analysis of 401(k) participants found that engaging in planning, either with a Fidelity representative or using Fidelity's online tools, helped some people identify opportunities to improve their plans, and take action.<sup>1</sup>

Roughly 40% of the people who took the time to look at their plan decided to make changes to their saving or investing strategy. The most common change was to increase savings, with an average increase of roughly 2.6% of pay.<sup>1</sup> The next most common action was a change in investments (see illustration below). A plan doesn't have to be fancy or expensive. You can do it alone, or with the help of a financial professional or an online tool like those in Fidelity's Planning & Guidance Center. Either way, by slowing down, focusing on your goals, and making a plan, you are taking the first and most important step. Be a supersaver While lots of attention is paid to how much your investments earn, the most important factors that determine your financial future may be how much and how often you save.

Fidelity's Retirement Savings Assessment analyzed financial information for more than 4,500 families and found that, on average, the single most powerful change that millennials and Gen Xers could make to improve their retirement outlooks was saving more. For workers closer to retirement, a combination of delaying retirement and saving more would have made the biggest difference, on average.<sup>2</sup>

How much should you save for retirement? As a general rule of thumb, Fidelity suggests putting at least 15% of your income each year, which includes any employer match, into a tax-advantaged retirement account, though your individual situation may be different.

""You can't control the markets, but you can control how much you save,"" says Fidelity vice president and CFP<sup>®</sup> Ann Dowd. ""Saving enough, and saving consistently, are important habits to achieve long-term financial goals."" Stick with your plan, despite volatility When the value of your investments falls significantly, it's only human to want to run for shelter due to our inherent aversion to suffering losses. And it can certainly feel better to stop putting additional money to work in the market. But the best investors understand their time horizon, financial capacity for losses, and emotional tolerance for market ups and downs, and they maintain an allocation of stocks they can live with in good markets and bad.

Remember the financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009 when stocks dropped nearly 50%? Selling at the top and buying at the bottom would have been ideal, but, unfortunately, that kind of market timing is nearly impossible. In fact, a Fidelity study of 1.5 million workplace savers found that those who stayed invested in the stock market during the downturn far outpaced those who went to the sidelines.<sup>3</sup>

From June of 2008 through the end of 2017, investors who stayed in the markets saw their account balances—which reflected the impact of their investment choices and contributions—grow 147%. That's twice the average 74% return for those who moved out of stocks and into cash during the fourth quarter of 2008 or first quarter of 2009.<sup>3</sup> More than 25% of the investors who sold out of stocks during that downturn never got back into the market—missing out on all of the recovery and gains of the following years. The vast majority of 401(k) participants did not make any asset allocation changes during the market downturn, but, for those who did, it was a fateful decision that had a lasting impact.

If you are tempted to move to cash when the stock market plunges, consider a more balanced, less volatile asset mix that you can stick with. Imagine 2 hypothetical investors: An investor who panicked, slashed his equity allocation from 90% to 20% during the bear markets in 2002 and 2008, and subsequently waited until the market recovered before moving his stock allocation back to a target level of 90%; and an investor who stayed the course during the bear markets with a 60%/40% allocation of stocks and bonds.<sup>4</sup>

As you can see below, the disciplined investor significantly outperformed the more aggressive investor who pulled back his equity exposure radically as the market fell. Assuming a $100,000 starting portfolio 22 years ago, the patient investor with the 60% stock allocation would have had about $540,000 by October 2018, versus $410,000 for the impatient investor. A difference of $130,000. Be diversified An old adage says that there is no free lunch in investing, meaning that if you want to increase potential returns, you have to accept more potential risk. But diversification is often said to be the exception to the rule—a free lunch that lets you improve the potential trade-off between risk and reward.

Successful investors know that diversification can help control risk—and their own emotions. Consider the performance of 3 hypothetical portfolios in the 5 years after the financial crisis 2008–2009 financial crisis: a 100% stock portfolio; a diversified portfolio of 70% stocks, 25% bonds, and 5% short-term investments; and an all-cash portfolio.

By the end of February 2009, both the all-stock and the diversified portfolios would have declined sharply (50% and 35%, respectively), while the all-cash portfolio would have risen 1.6%. 5 years after the bottom, the all-stock portfolio would have been the clear winner: up 162%, versus 100% for the diversified portfolio and just 0.3% for the cash portfolio. But over a longer period—from January 2008 through February 2014—the all-stock and diversified portfolios would have been neck and neck: up 32% and 30%, respectively.

This is what diversification is about. It will not maximize gains in rising stock markets, but it can capture a substantial portion of the gains over the longer term, with less volatility than just investing in stocks. That smoother ride will likely make it easier for you to stay the course when the market shakes, rattles, and rolls. A good habit is to diversify among stocks, bonds, and cash, but also within those categories and among investment types. Diversification cannot guarantee gains, or that you won’t experience a loss, but does aim to provide a reasonable trade-off of risk and reward for your personal situation. On the stock front, consider diversifying across regions, sectors, investment styles (value, blend, and growth) and size (small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks). On the bond front, consider diversifying across different credit qualities, maturities, and issuers. Consider low-fee investment products that offer good value Savvy investors know they can't control the market—or even the success of the fund managers they choose. What they can control is costs. A study by independent research company Morningstar found that expense ratios are the most reliable predictor of future fund performance—in terms of total return, and future risk-adjusted return ratings. (Read [details of the study](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/149421/how-fund-fees-are-the-best-predictor-of-returns.aspx).) Fidelity research has also shown that picking low-cost funds is one way to improve average historical results of large-cap stock funds relative to comparable index funds.

Fidelity has also found great variation among brokers in terms of commission and execution—by comparing the executed price of a security with the best bid or offer at the time of the trade. The cost of trading affects your returns.

Focus on generating after-tax returns While investors may spend a lot of time thinking about what parts of the market to invest in, successful investors know that's not the end of the story. They focus not just on what they make, but also on what they keep after taxes. That's why it is important to consider the investment account type and the tax characteristics of the investments that you have.

Accounts that offer tax benefits, like 401(k)s, IRAs, and certain annuities, can change to have the potential to help generate higher after-tax returns. This is what is known as ""account location""—how much of your money to put into different types of accounts, based on each account’s respective tax treatment. Then consider ""asset location""—which type of investments you keep in each account, based on the tax efficiency of the investment and the tax treatment of the account type.

Consider putting the least tax-efficient investments (for example, taxable bonds whose interest payments are taxed at relatively high ordinary income tax rates) in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. Put more tax-efficient investments (low-turnover funds, like index funds or ETFs, and municipal bonds, where interest is typically free from federal income tax) in taxable accounts.

Consider the example in the chart. A hypothetical $250,000 portfolio is invested and returns 6% annually for 20 years. The different tax treatments of a brokerage, annuity, and tax-deferred IRA, along with fees for those accounts, could create a significant difference in the final value of the investment. The bottom line There is a lot of complexity in the financial world, but some of the most important habits of successful investors are pretty simple. If you build a smart plan and stick with it, save enough, make reasonable investment choices, and beware of taxes, you will have adopted some of the key traits that may lead to investing success."

 *  Getting started ahead of time gives you plenty of time to look for opportunities to reduce your taxable income.
 *  If you end up owing money, starting early can mitigate some of the sticker shock since you'll have time to plan how to make the payment. Tax season is upon us with tax forms arriving in inboxes and mailboxes. Tackling your 2019 tax return may be a dreaded chore (because of complexity or the prospect of owing additional tax) or a welcome event (because you are due a refund). Either way, getting started early may help make your tax-filing season less stressful and potentially save you some money.

Beginning your tax preparation now may help you avoid surprises, give you more time to gather your documents, reduce your taxable income, and even protect you from identity theft.

Here are 7 reasons to get a start on your 2019 tax return now. 1. Protect yourself from identity theft Filing your tax return as soon as possible is one of the best ways to guard against tax-related identity theft. For the scheme to be successful, a criminal files a fraudulent return and collects a refund in your name before you file your return. If you file your legitimate return before a crook tries to file one for you, the fraudulent return is rejected.

If you haven't received the necessary tax documents from an employer, financial institution, charity, or some other source, be proactive and ask for them. On the other hand, if you owe a payment with your return and you need time to raise the money, you can file your return early and instruct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to deduct the amount from your bank account or debit card, or charge your credit card, on a specified date—right up until the filing deadline. (The deadline is April 15, 2020, for your 2019 taxes.) 2. Lower your taxable income You have several options for potentially reducing your taxable income with a contribution to a tax-advantaged account up until the tax deadline. The sooner you make a contribution, however, the sooner you'll be able to invest your contribution and give that money the chance to grow tax-deferred.

One opportunity available to many taxpayers is a contribution to a [traditional IRA](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/retirement-ira/traditional-ira). A contribution to a traditional IRA may reduce taxable income and, in turn, 2019 taxes for those eligible for the tax deduction.<sup>1</sup> The tax-deductible contribution limit for the 2019 tax year is $6,000. For those who are age 50 and over, the limit is $7,000.

It isn't necessary to have a job to have a traditional IRA. A nonworking spouse, as long as their spouse has earned income, can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. The amount of a married couple's combined contributions can't be more than the earned compensation reported on their joint return.

Self-employed individuals and freelancers can open a Simplified Employee Pension plan—more commonly known as a [SEP IRA](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/retirement-ira/small-business/sep-ira)—even if they also have a full-time job as an employee. Those who earn money freelancing or running a small business on the side could take advantage of the potential tax benefits from your side gig. With a SEP IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, just like with a traditional IRA, but the SEP IRA has a much higher contribution limit. The contribution amount varies based on income. For 2019, the contribution limit is 25% of eligible compensation (or 20% of eligible compensation for the self-employed<sup>2</sup>) or $56,000, whichever is lower. The deadline for 2019 contributions is the tax deadline—April 15, 2020. If you file an extension, you'll have until October 15, 2020, to make the contribution for 2019.

Consider speaking with a tax advisor to determine the impact of SEP IRA contributions on the tax deductibility of contributions to a traditional IRA in the context of your personal situation. 3. Review your 2018 tax return Looking back at your 2018 tax return can give you a great head start on what you'll need in order to prepare your return for 2019. You can see which financial institutions should be sending you tax documents, which charities you might have contributed to, and which deductions you might again be eligible to claim.

Here's another benefit to taking time to review your 2018 return: If you spot an error, you can file an amended return and possibly get back some money you thought was long gone. 4. Take into account significant life events Got married? Had a child? Divorced? Retired? Bought a new home? All of these and many others can have a significant impact on your tax return. Consider the effects they might have on your tax liability and how you file your return. If you are unsure of the effects, consult a tax professional. Newly married couples, for example, are typically better off filing a joint tax return, but there are circumstances, such as one spouse owing back taxes or having large medical bills, when filing separately may make sense. 5. Make a checklist After reviewing last year's return and any significant life events from 2019, make a checklist of items you need to prepare before filing your return. By starting early, you'll give yourself time to compile all the information you need and to explore potential tax-saving deductions and strategies. 6. Avoid ""sticker shock"" The last thing you want is to get to the bottom line and see an unexpected large balance owed to the IRS. If you wait until the last minute to prepare your taxes, you may not have time to raise the cash for the payment. Filing for an extension won't help. You still have to pay what you owe by the filing deadline or face a penalty and interest.

Last-minute surprises may become more common as larger numbers of Americans earn self-employment income from things such as driving for a ride-sharing service, renting out a room in their home, or performing consulting services. People engaged in these types of income-producing activities are typically required to pay estimated taxes each quarter (i.e., 4 times a year). If you're new to self-employment and failed to make quarterly payments, you'll probably need time to plan for any additional taxes due. 7. Catch errors in tax documents Tax preparation software is great at filling out forms and calculating your tax liability, but it doesn't always spot reporting errors in tax documents sent to you. Unless you catch them yourself, they could significantly impact your tax bill.

For example, suppose you received money from a lawsuit settlement or a sweepstakes prize and it was reported on a Form 1099-MISC. The amount should appear in Box 3, ""Other income,"" but if the issuer mistakenly placed it in Box 7, ""Nonemployee compensation,"" it would be considered self-employment income and subject to an additional 15.3% self-employment tax. Another example is Box 7 on Form 1099-R, which may contain a letter or number code as well as a check box for IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE distributions. The entries can make a difference in how you report the distribution and if it's taxed.

If you can't determine on your own what the proper entries should be on the forms you receive, you should consult a tax professional. Start as soon as you can By starting your tax return now and giving yourself time to resolve questions and issues that might arise, you may find the process less anxiety-producing and may discover some opportunities to help lower your tax bill."

Follow these best practices for safeguarding information.,Protect yourself from tax and financial scams. Follow these best practices for safeguarding information.," Key takeaways  *  Protect your personal information everywhere online and secure your mobile phone accounts with your phone provider.
 *  Learn to recognize phishing emails and calls. Don't trust calls from individuals claiming to represent technical support, the IRS, or your financial institutions.
 *  File your tax return as early as possible. Being contacted by the Internal Revenue Service can cause concern for any taxpayer, but imagine receiving a telephone call and hearing this:

""This prerecorded message is to notify you that the IRS has found fraud and misconduct on your tax return. This needs to be resolved immediately, and it's very important that I hear from you as soon as possible or a legal action will be taken against you.""

That's an actual message received by a real taxpayer, and reported to the IRS—but everything about the call is fake. It's a criminal scam, aimed at scaring victims into placing a call to the scammer who might demand an immediate cash payment, or attempt to obtain personal information that could be used for identity theft.

With tax-filing season in full swing, intimidating calls of this type try to take advantage of taxpayers' IRS anxiety. Most people are quick to spot the call as a fake since the IRS doesn't threaten taxpayers by telephone, emails, or text messages, or issue arrest warrants.

But the IRS ploy isn't the only scheme in the scam artists' bag of tricks, nor do they occur only at tax time. Other approaches may be more subtle, appearing to come from a company you trust and asking you to verify account information. Or the criminals may operate almost entirely behind the scenes, quietly gathering information about you that can be used for a wide range of identity fraud. The common thread in almost all of the schemes is that they rely on the victim to provide sensitive information or, at the very least, to be inattentive to the security of their personal information. 5 common scams Tax refund fraud A criminal, having illegally obtained your Social Security number, files a fraudulent tax return in your name and collects a refund. When you submit your legitimate tax return, it is rejected because the IRS has already processed a return with your Social Security number. In some cases, you may receive a notice prior to filing your return that the IRS has received a suspicious return using your identity.

What to do:

 *  File your return early, reducing the likelihood that a criminal would have previously filed a fraudulent return.
 *  If your return is rejected because of a duplicate filing under your Social Security number, submit [Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf), to the IRS.
 *  Remember, the IRS will contact you through the US Postal Service, not a phone call. If you receive a letter from the IRS that it has received a suspicious return using your identity, contact the IRS. Visit [IRS.gov](http://IRS.gov) for contact information.
 *  Do not return a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS.

Continue to pay your taxes and file your legitimate tax return, although you may have to submit a paper return rather than an electronic one. Attach Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, when filing your return. Employment or health care fraud A person uses your identity to obtain a job or receive health care services. You may become aware of the scheme after you file your tax return, and are notified by the IRS that you appear to have underreported your income and owe additional tax. Or, in the health care version of the scheme, you receive notification that you are required to pay for medical exams, procedures, and prescription drugs that you never received.

What to do:

 *  If you suspect you are a victim of taxpayer identity theft, immediately contact the IRS and file [Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf).
 *  Never surrender Social Security, Medicare or health insurance numbers to anyone you don't know and trust.
 *  If you believe someone has signed up for health insurance in your name, call the Health Insurance Marketplace call center at 800-318-2596, and explain the situation. Tech support scam You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be a technical support person, informing you that there is something wrong with your computer and the caller can help you fix the problem. Alternately, a message appears on your computer screen informing you that your computer is infected with viruses, or that you are locked out of your computer and your files have been encrypted, denying you access. If you follow the instructions of the caller or the screen message, your computer may be taken hostage and your personal information stolen. You are then asked to pay a fee to restore access to your computer or data.

What to do:

 *  Prevention is the best medicine. Don't click pop-up ads or attachments from unknown senders. Avoid clicking links in emails. Visit known websites by manually typing the URLs in a browser.
 *  Do not allow anyone to control your computer remotely and don’t give passwords and security codes to anyone on the phone.
 *  Hang up if you receive tech support call, and don't respond to scare messages about your computer being infected. If you need help with your computer, go to your local computer or electronics store.
 *  Back up your data regularly. That way, you can reboot and regain control of your computer by cleaning your hard drive and reinstalling your operating system. Credit card fraud Someone using your identity signs up for a credit card and racks up large charges. A crook who obtains a new card could use it extensively before being discovered. Sometimes, a stolen identity is used to obtain personal loans or open unauthorized financial accounts. You will likely learn about this when bills are not paid and collection agencies start calling for payments.

You may notice either you are not getting any postal mail or you start receiving confirmation or decline letters for credit cards or loans that you did not initiate.

What to do:

 *  Report the crime and start a recovery plan on [IdentityTheft.gov](http://IdentityTheft.gov).
 *  Notify law enforcement officials.
 *  Consider freezing your credit files if you do not have any plans to take new credit cards or loans. Beginning September 21, 2018, you can freeze and unfreeze your credit file for free. Read more about it on the [Federal Trade Commission website](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/09/starting-today-new-law-allows-consumers-place-free-credit-freezes).
 *  Put a [fraud alert](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert) on your credit reports, which notifies lenders and creditors that they should take extra steps to verify your identity before extending credit. Contact one of the 3 credit bureaus to report the crime (Equifax at 800-525-6285, Experian at 888-397-3742 or TransUnion at 800-680-7289). For a fee, these credit bureaus can also help with freezing your credit files, to prevent unauthorized activity. Fake charities You are solicited by email, phone, or in person to contribute to an organization that sounds like a good cause but is actually a scam. Such schemes may be general in nature, often using a name very similar to a well-known charity, or they may be more targeted, attempting to prey on people who are victims of a natural disaster or known to have a personal interest in a particular disease or social cause. These days, charity scams are also being circulated through social media posts such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and LinkedIn.

What to do:

 *  Before contributing, research the charity through the [Better Business Bureau's (BBB) Wise Giving Alliance](http://www.give.org/), [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/home), or [GuideStar](http://www.guidestar.org/Home.aspx).
 *  If you suspect you have been a victim of charity fraud, file a complaint on [IdentityTheft.gov](http://IdentityTheft.gov). How to protect yourself The good news is that you can protect yourself in most cases, by being aware of the threat and following certain practices for safeguarding your information. 1. Don't take the phishing bait Phishing is a technique used by criminals to trick victims into providing personal information that can be used for identity theft. Most phishing attempts are carried out by email, text messages, or phone.

 *  Ignore deals, freebies, and awards that sound too good to be true. Disregard offers that appear to come from unusual foreign contacts, as well as requests from strangers for help.
 *  Ignore phone calls, emails, or texts that appear to be from the IRS. The agency will not contact you by phone, email, text message, or social media to request personal or financial information.
 *  Be suspicious of anyone requesting your Social Security number, date of birth, financial account number, PIN, email, or passwords—especially if there is a request to verify your information when you were not expecting it.
 *  Never click a link or download an attachment inside an unexpected email. If the email claims to be from a company you do business with, don't log in from a link in the email message—go to the company's website and log in to your account from there.
 *  Never provide personal information over the phone to an unsolicited caller. If you think the call might be a legitimate request from a company you do business with, hang up, and call the company directly. 2. Protect your phone service Your phone has become an important part of security protocol and is the ""master key"" to accessing online accounts and information.

Criminals and scam artists are actively using stolen identity information to port your mobile phone number, or forward your phone calls and text messages. They do this by calling phone service providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Xfinity, etc. If you use Voice over IP (VoIP) phones such as from Xfinity, Verizon FIOS, Google Voice, etc., then your voice phone portal accounts are also at risk.

Cyber criminals do this to steal your 2-factor authentication codes and text messages to get into your financial institution accounts.

 *  Learn signs that your phone may be hacked. If you notice your mobile phone showing ""no service"" or ""emergency calls only,"" or you stop receiving phone calls and text messages even after you restart your phone, contact your mobile company to see if your account has been compromised.
 *  Ask your telecom provider about ways to better secure your account, especially verifying your identity with a PIN or 2-factor authentication to make changes, route phone calls, forward phone messages, or port your phone number.
 *  Secure your online phone and internet service provider account where you pay bills and manage settings. Use a separate and strong password for such accounts and enable 2-factor authentication on these accounts. 3. Monitor and secure your accounts Many companies, including Fidelity, go to great lengths to safeguard customers' information and provide security tools. For instance, Fidelity offers 2-factor authentication, designed to prevent someone from accessing your account, even if they have your password.

Here are a few actions you can take to reinforce those safeguards.

 *  Choose passwords that can't be guessed easily. Use different passwords for different websites, and change them regularly.
 *  Sign up for 2-factor authentication at your financial institutions and email service providers to protect all your online accounts.
 *  Make sure your financial institutions have up-to-date contact information for you, especially your mobile number. Your financial institutions use this information to protect your accounts and to contact you when suspicious activity is detected.
 *  Sign up for automated alerts of suspicious account activity wherever offered. Fidelity automatically alerts you by email and text messages of certain suspicious activity. Do not ignore these text alerts whenever received.
 *  Check your credit report regularly. The 3 major agencies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—are required by law to provide you with a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months, which means you can check your report for free 3 times throughout the year. 4. Secure your mobile devices and personal computers Any device you use that is connected to the internet can become a mechanism of attack by cyber-criminals. Hackers can get in through newly discovered security holes in these devices and systems.

 *  Apply updates and patches as soon as the system maker releases them.
 *  Don’t download mobile apps and games that you do not trust. Some mobile apps have been found to contain hidden malicious software. Use your best judgment before using a brand new app from an unknown company and read reviews before downloading.
 *  Run antivirus software on your computers, and ensure that your mobile devices have the most recent security updates and patches. Keep good habits Security measures aren't foolproof, and anybody can suffer a moment of inattention or lapse in judgment. Nevertheless, awareness and basic prevention practices can protect you from the vast majority of attempts to steal your identity or money through fraudulent schemes."

You can withdraw your contributions at any time and any potential earnings can be withdrawn tax-free<sup>1</sup> in retirement.
 *  You aren't required to take distributions from a Roth IRA as you are with a traditional IRA.
 *  Contributing to a Roth IRA gives you tax flexibility in retirement.

Do you want to help lower your taxes in retirement and increase your retirement savings? A Roth IRA, with its tax-free growth potential and tax-free withdrawals for you and your heirs, is a way you may be able to do just that (as long as certain requirements are met).<sup>1</sup> And those are just a couple of the benefits of a Roth IRA.

One important note: Not everyone can contribute to a Roth IRA, because of IRS income limits. If your income is over the limits, you still may be able to have a Roth IRA by converting existing money in a traditional IRA or other retirement savings account. (See the section ""If you earn too much to contribute,"" at the end of this article.) 1. Money can grow tax-free; withdrawals are tax-free too You contribute money that has already been taxed (after-tax dollars) to a Roth IRA. There's no tax deduction as there can be with a traditional IRA. But, any growth or earnings from the investments in the account—and any distributions you take out in retirement—are free from federal taxes (and may also be free from state and local taxes too), with a few conditions.<sup>1</sup> 2. There are no required minimum distributions Roth IRAs do not have required minimum distributions (RMDs) for the original owner. Traditional IRAs and, generally, 403(b)s, Roth and traditional 401(k)s, and other employer-sponsored retirement savings plans do. If you don't need your distributions for essential expenses, RMDs may be hard to keep track of. The RMDs have to be calculated and withdrawn each year, and may result in taxable income. Because a Roth IRA eliminates the need to take RMDs, it may also enable you to pass on more of your retirement savings to your heirs (see below). 3. Leave tax-free money to heirs In many cases, a Roth IRA has legacy and estate planning benefits, but you need to consider the pros and cons—which can be subtle and complex. Be sure to consult an attorney or estate planning expert before attempting to use Roth IRAs as part of an estate plan. While RMDs are required for inherited Roth IRAs, as they are for inherited traditional IRAs, distributions from inherited Roth IRAs generally remain tax-free. 4. Tax flexibility in retirement You've already paid the taxes on the contributions to a Roth IRA, so as long as you follow the rules, you get to take out your money tax-free. Mixing how you take withdrawals between your traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, or other qualified accounts, and Roth IRAs may enable you to better manage your overall income tax liability in retirement. You could, for example, take withdrawals from a traditional IRA until your taxable income reaches the top of a tax bracket, and then take additional money you need from a Roth IRA. 5. Help reduce or even avoid the Medicare surtax A Roth IRA may potentially help limit your exposure to the Medicare surtax on net investment income. This is because qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA don't count toward the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) threshold that determines the surtax. RMDs from traditional (i.e., pre-tax) accounts such as a workplace retirement plan—like a traditional 401(k)—or a traditional IRA, are included in MAGI and do count toward the MAGI threshold for the surtax. So depending on your income in retirement, RMDs could expose you to the Medicare surtax, and using Roth accounts might help you avoid it. 6. Hedge against future tax hikes Will tax rates rise in the future? There's no way to know for certain, but the top federal income tax rate remains far below its historical highs, and if you think it might go up again, a Roth IRA may make sense. 7. Use your contributions at any time A Roth IRA enables you to take out 100% of what you have contributed at any time and for any reason, with no taxes or penalties. Only earnings and converted balances in the Roth IRA are subject to restrictions on withdrawals. Generally, withdrawals from a Roth IRA are considered to come from contributions first. Distributions from converted balances and earnings—which can be taxable and/or subject to penalties if the conditions are not met—begin only when all contributions have been withdrawn. 8. If you're older, you can continue to contribute as long as you work As long as you have earned compensation, whether it is a regular paycheck or 1099 income for contract work, you can contribute to a Roth IRA—no matter how old you are. There is no age requirement for contributions, but you must be within the income limits in order to contribute to a Roth IRA.

Learn more on Fidelity.com: [IRA contribution limits](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/retirement-ira/contribution-limits-deadlines) 9. If you're young, your income is likely to rise Generally speaking, the younger you are, the greater the chance that your income will be higher when you retire than it is now. For instance, if you're under age 30, it's possible that your income and spending during retirement will be significantly higher than they are now, at the beginning of your career. And the greater the difference between your income now and your income in retirement, the more advantageous a Roth account can be. If you earn too much to contribute In order to contribute to a Roth IRA, you must have employment compensation, and there are also income limits. If your income (as measured by MAGI) is over the IRS limits, the only way you can take advantage of a Roth IRA is by converting money from an existing retirement account, such as a traditional IRA.<sup>2</sup> There is a cost, though. You'll generally need to pay taxes on what you convert, but any after-tax contributions to a traditional account will not be taxable. The rules are complex, so if you have made after-tax contributions to a traditional account and you're interested in conversion, be sure to consult with a tax advisor.

 *  Are you saving tax-efficiently?
 *  Are you protecting your income?
 *  Are you preserving your assets?
 *  How does your plan affect your family? When are you most likely to do a reality check on your overall financial health? Is it when your investments are doing well? Or is it when the markets are down and you're nervous? Chances are it is the latter, which may not be the optimal time to make investment decisions, particularly if emotions are high. That's why taking the time to do an annual review of your investments and other financial matters makes sense.

""Careful planning is essential in all economic climates, but it's particularly valuable in times of market turmoil,"" says Ann Dowd, CFP<sup>®</sup>, vice president at Fidelity. ""Think of it as if you are planning for a road trip. That's not the time to check your brakes and tires. You do that before, so you know they are in good shape.""

An annual financial checkup can take place at any time during the year and can help you better understand the ""big picture"" of your overall financial planning efforts. You can stop and think about your family's financial goals, such as saving for retirement, a house, or a child's education. You can consider reducing taxes on your investments, protecting your income, or building a financial cushion.

Once you are clear on your goals, you can then work on ensuring that you are saving and investing appropriately for those goals. And while you are looking at your accounts and holdings, take care of ""housekeeping"" items too, like checking beneficiaries and completing a health care proxy, which are not complicated but can have serious consequences if neglected.

Here are 5 questions to ask when you do a financial review. 1. Is my investment strategy on track? You probably have several savings goals and accounts. Your annual financial review should revisit each of your priorities and your strategy for reaching them. If your situation has changed, make adjustments as necessary. At least once a year, check your target asset mix to ensure that it continues to meet your time frame, risk tolerance, needs, and preferences, and to perform any rebalancing that might be necessary in light of the past year's market performance.

On your own or with your advisor, take some time to look at specific investments and evaluate whether they continue to have a role in your portfolio. It's important to match your investments to certain time frames or specific goals. Some may be long term such as saving for a child's education or your retirement. Others may be more short term such as saving for a new car, a vacation home, or travel.

For example, you may take on more risk saving for a retirement that is decades away, or you may want more conservative investment options to fund 25% of a grandchild's college education in 5 years. Or, you may earmark $35,000 from a particular fund this year to pay for a new car for your spouse. As part of your annual review, give your portfolio a regular checkup with an eye to diversification. The goal of diversification is not necessarily to boost performance—it won't ensure gains or guarantee against losses. But once you target a level of risk—based on your goals, time horizon, and tolerance for volatility—diversification may provide the potential to improve returns for that level of risk.

**Tip:** To build a diversified portfolio, consider looking for investments—stocks, bonds, cash, or others—whose returns haven't historically moved in the same direction and to the same degree. This way, even if a portion of your portfolio is declining, the rest of your portfolio has an opportunity to grow, or potentially not decline as much. 2. Am I saving tax-efficiently? Beyond applying diversification strategies broadly to your overall portfolio, what approaches are you exploring to help defer, reduce, or more efficiently manage taxes on your investments? Investing tax-efficiently doesn't have to be complicated, but it does take some planning. While taxes should never be the sole driver of an investment strategy, better tax awareness does have the potential to improve your returns. Morningstar estimates investors gave up an average of 1% to 2% of return per year to taxes for the 92 years through 2018. Let's say a portfolio could earn 8% per year instead of 6%, that extra return of 2% per year on a hypothetical portfolio of $100,000 could result in an additional $1 million after 40 years.\*

Although you cannot control market returns or tax law, you can control how you use accounts that offer certain tax advantages. This type of approach is often referred to as active asset location. Employing this strategy allows you to choose which assets to keep in your tax-advantaged accounts and which to leave in your taxable accounts. In general, the more tax-inefficient an investment is, the more tax you pay on it.

Our basic rule of thumb: Consider putting certain investments which generate taxable income—for example taxable bonds and real estate investment trusts—in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For those investments which are more ""tax-efficient""—like stocks and ETFs held for more than a year—place them in taxable accounts.

**Tip:** Asset and account location should be considered within the context of tax efficiency and maintaining an appropriate asset mix. Asset location is the strategic matching of asset type and account type based on the asset's tax efficiency and the tax treatment of different account registration types. Account location is the strategic ordering of money flows to potentially help minimize taxes and help determine where to invest or where to withdraw from next, depending on your situation.

Are you already taking full advantage of a 401(k) plan, Keogh, IRA, or other qualified account that may be available to you? Generally, these accounts are the best place to start a program of active asset location, because of their tax advantages, but each comes with contribution and withdrawal restrictions.

If you are entering retirement and transitioning from saving to spending, a tax-savvy withdrawal strategy can help your savings last through retirement. While the traditional withdrawal hierarchy of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt assets is a good starting point, individual situations and changing circumstances may require making adjustments. Aim to withdraw no more than 4%–5% from your savings each year to help ensure that your savings will last for 20 to 30 years in retirement. 3. Am I protecting my income? You've worked hard and want to protect your income. So it's wise to evaluate your family's total insurance needs annually to make sure you have the right amount and type of insurance to cover unforeseen circumstances that can derail a financial plan.

Life insurance may be a good place to start. If your family is growing, you might want to increase the amount of your life insurance to protect your loved ones. On the other hand, many people find as their net worth climbs and their children reach adulthood, they need less life insurance.

If you choose to reduce your life insurance, you may want to apply the savings toward your health insurance, which becomes more critical as you age and continues to increase in cost. You might also benefit from looking into long-term care insurance, which may offer a variety of features and options.

One more thing: Your annual review should also include a simple check of your insurance beneficiary designations to see whether they are up to date. 4. Am I preserving my assets? Use your annual review to make sure you have an estate plan, and that it continues to reflect your family status and financial situation. Ensure that it helps make the best use of the latest estate and tax laws, and that key individuals know where to find relevant documents and information.

If you do have an estate plan, do the people you care about know about it? Where is it, and what role should your loved ones play if something happens to you? Marriage, divorce, birth, and death are the 4 big events that affect estate plans, but you may also want to consider other factors, such as longevity and health, that could affect your planning.

Thinking about a will, health care proxy, and power of attorney can be uncomfortable, but consider the alternative. Do you want someone else making these decisions for you? If you don't have any of these key documents, take the time to set them up. If you have them, review not only your paperwork but any life events that have occurred. Changing careers, moving, having children or grandchildren, or losing a loved one can have a big impact on your plan overall. 5. How does my financial plan affect my family? It's not just your retirement or financial future that you are planning for, especially as you age. You are likely researching and cultivating strategies to provide financial assistance to a number of people that you care deeply for, including parents, children, or even grandchildren. Beyond college, a lot of parents are helping to launch their millennial children into the world of fully independent living. Meanwhile, many have aging parents who can no longer live on their own or manage their own financial and personal affairs. Will caring for others affect your financial goals, priorities, and outcomes?

An annual review can help prioritize financial decisions that you need to make to support your family's goals across the generations—and help tee up long-neglected family money conversations. It can help you bring your family together to sort through vital matters related to such things as college savings, caregiving responsibilities, health care decisions, estate planning, and the tax implications of an inheritance. Take a long-term view for your family While all this might sound like a lot of ground to cover, an annual review is well worth the effort when you consider the hard work you have invested in building and protecting your wealth. Says Dowd: ""It's important to have a long-term view of your financial strategies. The annual review can be scheduled at any point throughout the year. It represents an opportunity to reassess your investment and financial situation, while also thinking about future milestones and moments that matter for the people you care about the most."""

 *  What will produce the greatest wealth?
 *  When will you need your money?
 *  How important is paying off debt to you emotionally? Owning your home free and clear probably sounds awesome—no more payments to the bank, lower monthly expenses, the security and pride of knowing you own your house outright. In fact, for some people, paying off the mortgage may seem like a requirement before retirement.

But when it comes to paying off a mortgage early, feelings are just one factor to consider. You should also weigh the financial aspects of the decision. When it comes to dollars and cents, the decision can be complicated: Paying off a mortgage early will help some people financially, and make less sense for others.

How do you know if paying off a mortgage can help you financially?

A key factor is to consider what the money would do if you didn't pay off the loan. Paying off your mortgage is a little bit like investing at a fixed rate of return. Meaning, if you owe $5,000 on a mortgage and pay it down over 3 years at 5% interest, you are going to pay about $500 in interest. If you pay the loan off, you save that $500—that savings is sort of like a ""return,"" and has a similar effect on your net worth.<sup>1</sup>

But that raises the question, what if the returns from your investment portfolio are different than your loan's interest rate? If you have a higher interest rate than your investment returns, prepaying your mortgage might benefit you long-term. But if you were to earn an investment return that outpaces your interest rate, paying off the loan may not make sense.<sup>1</sup>

Fidelity recently completed an analysis that looked at different mortgage interest rates and hypothetical market performance for a number of different portfolios to see the financial impact of prepaying a mortgage. The study looked at 3 different measures:

 *  **Plan strength:** Did prepaying a loan decrease the risk of running out of money in retirement compared to investing?
 *  **Volatility:** Did prepaying decrease the volatility of the portfolio?
 *  **Wealth:** Was the balance higher at the end of the plan?

""The results show that in general, more aggressive investors might have been better off continuing to invest,"" says Mike Rusinak, a director of Fidelity's Financial Solutions group. ""More conservative investors, in general, might have been better off prepaying the debt. This is another reason it makes sense to create a holistic financial plan that covers many aspects of your financial life.""

This analysis relied on hypothetical market performance and interest rates and assumed the savings were available in cash. There are some important factors to keep in mind about this study. Because tax situations vary so much from one person to another, this analysis did not account for taxes—actual results may be different.

If you needed to sell appreciated stock or withdraw the money from a 401(k) or other tax-deferred account, you would have to pay taxes. That would increase the cost of paying off a loan—meaning even borrowers with lower interest rates might benefit from staying invested. The mortgage interest tax break lowers the cost of a mortgage, so for those who itemize deductions, losing the mortgage interest deduction also reduces the savings if you pay it off. So people who benefit from that deduction might need a higher rate before it makes sense to pay off the loan.

The bottom line is that this analysis can give you a rough idea of the relationship between investment style and the benefits of paying off a mortgage early, but it is important to consider your own situation and consult with an advisor before taking action.

| Source: Fidelity Investments. The analysis to determine the mortgage rate break points displayed in this chart makes several assumptions. It models a retirement time horizon of 27 years comparing 2 scenarios 1) no changes are made 2) the entirety of the mortgage is paid off using assets from a 401(k) and there are no early withdrawal penalties for the retirement account. The analysis does not account for income taxes paid on the withdrawal. Taxes and fees could impact the benefits of either strategy. Using a Monte Carlo framework with proprietary capital market assumptions (which are subject to change) for mid-2019, 1000 simulations are run on these scenarios. At the end of each simulation 3 main statistics are reported: 1) incidence of asset exhaustion; 2) portfolio volatility; 3) ending wealth. If at a given interest rate and asset allocation the scenario which pays down the mortgage improves upon the base scenario in all 3 measures it is deemed a reasonable indication to pay down the mortgage given that interest rate and asset allocation. In the base case the mortgage is assumed to be refinanced if rates decline before maturity. Mortgage rates are proxied by the 20-year treasury rate plus a spread. This analysis does not incorporate any taxes or investment fees. For taxpayers who itemize expenses these numbers may not be appropriate, and the required interest rate to consider paying down debt might be higher. Some housing fees, including taxes and insurance, will not change regardless of a mortgage. See [disclosure for more information about how these numbers were calculated](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/extra-mortgage-payment#Footnotes). |                                                                   |

Your investment outlook is just 1 factor when it comes to paying off your debt. Consider these 4 questions. 1. Can you afford to prepay your mortgage? Before you pay down your mortgage ahead of schedule, you need to make sure you aren't neglecting other important needs. For instance, if you have high-interest credit cards, or higher-interest short-term debt on a car, or a private student loan, you should look at paying off that debt before you consider paying off what may be a lower-interest-rate mortgage.

Also, if you are still working and have not taken full advantage of an IRA or 401(k), those savings options come with significant tax benefits, and maybe even an employer match. The tax benefits and match may make investing in these accounts more appealing than paying off low-interest-rate debt, like a mortgage—particularly if you are concerned you won't have enough funds for retirement. 2. What will produce the greatest wealth? If your goal is to end up with as much money as possible—for instance, to leave a legacy for charity or your children, paying off your mortgage early may not make the most sense. As shown above, this is particularly true for investors with significant stock holdings, or low-rate mortgages. 3. When will you need your money? Another key tradeoff between investing and prepaying is flexibility. Generally speaking, it's easier to access money in an investment account than money that's locked up in home equity, and prepaying a mortgage means you'll have more home equity and less money in investment accounts. Tapping into savings in your home equity requires selling your home and moving, setting up a home equity line of credit, or possibly a reverse mortgage. Those options vary in complexity and cost, but in general, the investment account will be easier to access in the event you want or need to spend the money on short notice. 4. How important is paying off debt to you emotionally? Fidelity research has shown that taking on debt can really weigh on a person’s sense of wellbeing—for some, the burden is even greater than going through a major reorganization at work or other stressful life event. On the other hand, paying off debt can have a big positive impact, even more than a promotion or exercising.

If you are very conservative, the appeal of a predictable return on your money, and the security of knowing that your house is paid up may have value beyond the dollars and cents involved. In that case, prepaying a mortgage may make more sense than the math would imply. Eliminating debt also reduces your monthly income needs, and that is another kind of flexibility. Case study: prepayment in action Let's take a look at a hypothetical example. Say Joan is 10 years into a 30-year mortgage with an interest rate of 4%, an outstanding balance close to $275,000, and a monthly payment of about $1,300. She is approaching retirement and trying to decide if she should use her savings to pay off the mortgage before she stops working.

Let's say Joan is a conservative investor—she holds about 20% of her portfolio in stocks, about 50% in bonds, and 30% in cash. If she prepays her mortgage, our estimate indicates she will end up improving her financial condition by reducing the risk of running out of money in retirement by about 10%, and improving her final balance by about 3% on average.<sup>2</sup>

But what if she was a more aggressive investor and held 70% of her portfolio in stocks and 25% in bonds and 5% in cash. According to our estimates, if Joan decides to prepay, she would still reduce her risk of running out of money. But in terms of wealth, the outcome would likely change: Instead of increasing her final balance, prepaying the mortgage would actually hurt her wealth. Because her investments would have grown more than savings from repayment, Joan would see her final balance decrease by about 10% on average.

""Prepaying debt sort of functions like buying an annuity: You reduce your risk by creating a guaranteed return equivalent to the interest rate on the mortgage,"" says Rusinak. ""For some investors, that certainty might be compelling, but for others it has the potential to actually reduce wealth."" The bottom line There can be some real benefits—both financial and emotional—to prepaying your mortgage. You reduce your total interest payments, you reduce your monthly spending needs, and you have the security of a predictable financial benefit and the psychological benefits of knowing you are out of debt.

But you may also want to weigh the benefits of getting rid of debt against the opportunity presented by investing. Prepaying a mortgage may not produce as much total wealth as investing, and it also may make it harder to tap your assets in the event of an emergency, or change in plans. It may be worth considering investing if you are more comfortable with risk, short on retirement savings, value flexibility, or if your main goal is growing your wealth."

 *  No current-year taxes on investment earnings
 *  Simplified tax recordkeeping Do you actively trade mutual funds or ETFs? Or do you follow a sector rotation strategy, moving in and out of sectors depending on business cycle and market trends, with a portion of your overall well-diversified portfolio? If so, you might generate considerable short-term capital gains, which are taxed annually at high ordinary income tax rates. For investors in higher tax brackets, the impact to returns can be significant.

The good news is that there are ways to help reduce the tax bill. One strategy would be to make tactical trades in tax-deferred accounts, such as workplace savings plans, IRAs, and tax-deferred variable annuities. Tax-deferred variable annuities often are overlooked but, for investors who have maximized contributions to workplace savings plans and IRAs, they are an option worth considering.

With a tax-deferred variable annuity, gains on trades are taxed at withdrawal, enabling deferred growth potential.\* Also, unlike retirement accounts, annuities have no contribution limits, a plus for higher-income investors. And annuities don't have required minimum distributions (RMDs), with many annuities allowing tax-deferred investing until age 90 or later.

And for those who engage in active trading, doing so inside a tax-deferred variable annuity can simplify an investor's life in other ways as well. In addition to no longer having to worry about paying the current-year tax liability from trades, you won't have to handle the tax recordkeeping and filing chore that goes with it. ""You can focus on investing and adapting without considering tax implications,"" says Tom Ewanich, a vice president and actuary at Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company.

Of course, there are caveats. Annuities can sometimes carry heavy fees, so you will want to shop for a low-cost product from a reputable provider. You may also sacrifice some liquidity because withdrawals of earnings before age 59½ are penalized. Investment choices may be limited. And in contrast to a taxable brokerage account, with an annuity you lose the opportunity to offset tax losses against gains or capture lower capital gains rates on withdrawals of long-term gains.

Still, for some higher-net-worth, active investors, the tradeoffs may be worth it. Says Tom Ewanich, ""For an investor with a time horizon of 10 years or more, a tax-deferred variable annuity is worth looking into. Most people don't like paying more taxes than they have to, and the ability to control your distributions and potentially manage your tax bracket can be very attractive."" One approach to frequent trading: Sector rotation strategy The business cycle has 4 phases that reflect fluctuations in the US economy, and each phase may have an effect on sector performance. Historically, some sectors tend to perform better or worse than others in certain phases. Monitoring the business cycle may help you determine which sectors you should focus your investing on during each phase. How much more can you keep? Gains on investments held a year or less in fully taxable accounts are taxed at the investor's marginal income tax rate, which is typically much higher than the long-term capital gains tax rate. Married couples filing jointly with taxable income of more than $622,050 in 2020, for example, would owe 37% federal tax on short-term capital gains, and even more if they're subject to the 3.8% Medicare surcharge on investment income. In addition, state and local taxes could raise the total.

Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, are taxed at 15% for single taxpayers with taxable income between $40,001 and $441,450, and at 20% for those with income above that amount. For married couples filing jointly, the 15% range is $80,001 to $496,600, and the rate is 20% above that level. Long-term capital gains rates increase to 18.8% and 23.8% for taxpayers subject to the Medicare surcharge. And, again, state and local taxes can also raise the total rate.

Although earnings withdrawn from a tax-deferred variable annuity are taxed as ordinary income—the same as short-term capital gains—the effect of tax-deferred compound earnings over time is what can give a low-cost annuity an advantage over a fully taxable account for investors who trade frequently.

Plus, many people may drop into a lower tax bracket when they retire, further strengthening the case for paying taxes later rather than sooner. So for those who expect a drop in their income tax bracket as a result of lower taxable income, expect to move to a state with lower income taxes, or think that their tax rates will drop for any other reason after retirement, the use of a tax-deferred variable annuity can be particularly attractive. Making a decision If you have a longer time horizon, have already reached the maximum contribution limits in your 401(k) or IRA, and/or your investment approach lines up with the annuity's key advantages, a tax-deferred variable annuity may be suitable for you—particularly if you are thinking about a sector rotation investment strategy. Be sure to consult an investment professional as you develop your plan."

If you own company stock in such a plan, there is a tax break that could save you a bundle on taxes—if you qualify. Anyone who owns company stock will eventually have to decide how to distribute those assets—typically when you retire or change employers. Taking a distribution could leave you facing a tax bill, but a little-known tax break—dealing with net unrealized appreciation (NUA)—has the potential to help.

""The tax treatment of net unrealized assets could be a significant break for an investor with a sizable company stock holding, particularly if the assets have appreciated a great deal or the investor plans to tap the funds in the short term,"" says Steven Feinschreiber, senior vice president, Fidelity Investments. ""Of course, you don't want to let taxes dictate investing decisions. Make sure to first consider the sale in light of your allocation, cash flow needs, and long-term goals—then see if this tax strategy makes sense for you."" Defining NUA NUA is the difference between the price you initially paid for a stock (its cost basis) and its current market value. Say you can buy company stock in your plan for $20 per share, and you use $2,000 to purchase 100 shares. Five years later, the shares are worth $35 each, for a total value of $3,500: $2,000 of that figure would be your cost basis and $1,500 would be NUA.

Why should you care about NUA? When you want to distribute company stock or its cash value out of your 401(k), you will face a choice: Roll it into an IRA, or distribute the company stock into a taxable account and roll the remaining assets into an IRA. The latter option might be more effective, depending on your circumstances, thanks to IRS rules governing NUA of company stock.

When you transfer most types of assets from a 401(k) plan to a taxable account, you pay income tax on their market value. But with company stock, you pay income tax only on the stock’s cost basis—not on the amount it gained since you bought it. (If you are under age 59½, you may also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty.)

When you sell your shares, you’ll pay long-term capital gains tax on the stock's NUA. The maximum federal capital gains tax rate is currently 20%, far lower than the 37% top income tax rate, so your potential tax savings may be substantial. How to qualify for NUA treatment You must meet all 4 of the following criteria to take advantage of the NUA rules:

 *  You must distribute your entire vested balance in your plan within one tax year (though you don't have to take all distributions at the same time).
 *  You must distribute all assets from all qualified plans you hold with the employer, even if only one holds company stock.
 *  You must take the distribution of company stock as actual shares. You may not convert them to cash before the distribution.
 *  You must have experienced one of the following:
    1. Separation from service from the company whose plan holds the stock (except in the case of self-employed workers)
    2. Reached age 59½
    3. Total disability (for self-employed workers only)
    4. Death ""The IRS enforces these rules strictly,"" says Feinschreiber. ""If you do not meet one of the criteria—for example, if you fail to distribute all assets within one tax year—your NUA election will be disqualified, and you would owe ordinary income taxes and any penalty on the entire amount of the company stock distribution.""

For more information on these complex rules, as well as situations that trigger additional tax restrictions, review IRS Publication 575, [Pension and Annuity Income](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p575.pdf), which is available at IRS.gov. When to choose NUA treatment Consider the following factors as you decide whether to roll all your assets into an IRA or to transfer company stock separately into a taxable account:

**Tax rates.** The larger the difference between the ordinary income tax rate and the long-term capital gains tax rate, the greater the potential tax savings of electing NUA tax treatment of company stock.

**Absolute NUA.** The larger the dollar value of the stock's appreciation, the more the NUA rules can save you on taxes.

**Percentage of NUA.** An NUA that is a higher percentage of total market value creates greater potential tax savings because more of the proceeds will be taxed at the lower capital gains rate and less will be taxed at income tax rates.

**Time horizon to distribution.** The longer you plan to keep your assets invested in an IRA, the greater the potential benefit of that account's tax-deferred growth. A shorter time frame makes the NUA election more attractive. A hypothetical case study An executive in the 37% tax bracket decides to retire at age 50. She holds $100,000 worth of company stock with a cost basis of $20,000, resulting in NUA of $80,000, and she wants immediate access to the cash.

She decides to distribute the assets into a taxable account and elect NUA tax treatment. She pays income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty on just her $20,000 cost basis—a total of $9,400. She then immediately sells her company stock and pays 20% capital gains tax on the stock's $80,000 NUA. In all, she pays taxes and penalties of $25,400, leaving her with $74,600. Imagine she instead rolled her company stock into an IRA, then sold the shares and withdrew the cash. In that case, she would pay income tax and penalties on the entire $100,000, for a total of $37,000 in income tax and $10,000 in early withdrawal penalties. As a result, she would wind up with just $53,000.

Please note that results will differ depending on the individual, after the stock moves into a taxable account, and the percentage of NUA. But, in this scenario, NUA tax treatment is clearly the better choice. The executive's high tax bracket and substantial NUA, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of her company stock's market value, enabled the NUA rule to produce considerable tax savings. If, on the other hand, the executive planned to wait 15 years or more to tap her company stock, the full IRA rollover likely would have been more advantageous. Whether she left the company stock in the IRA or sold it to invest in other securities, her investments could have generated tax-deferred growth—which would probably eventually outweigh the NUA's initial tax savings. The importance of advice The decision whether to take NUA treatment can be complicated. Certain situations may trigger restrictions on the NUA strategy. What's more, you should consider the way your distribution strategy affects your overall financial plan, including your estate plan, charitable giving, and—perhaps most important—the level of diversification in your portfolio. A tax professional or financial advisor can help you determine whether the NUA rule applies to your individual circumstances and, if so, how best to deploy it."

 *  Your retirement income and essential expenses
 *  Your life expectancy
 *  Wealth transfer plans Faced with mounting pension costs and greater volatility, companies are increasingly offering their current and former employees a critical choice: Take a lump-sum payment now or hold on to their pension plan.

""Companies are offering these buyouts as a way to shrink the size of future pension obligations, which ultimately reduces the impact of that pension plan on the company's financials,"" says John Beck, senior vice president for benefits consulting at Fidelity Investments. ""From an employee's perspective, the decision comes down to a trade-off between an income stream and a pile of money that's made available to him or her today.""

Pension buyouts can be offered to any current or former employee of a firm. You may have a vested benefit from a former employer, or your current company may be offering you a pension lump-sum buyout long before you retire.

Whatever the case, here's how a pension lump-sum payment offer typically works: Your employer issues a notice that, by a certain date, eligible employees must decide whether to exchange a monthly benefit payment in the future for a one-time lump-sum payment. If you opt for the lump sum, you or an eligible tax-qualified plan such as an IRA will most likely receive a check or IRA rollover from the company's pension fund for that amount, and the company's pension (or defined benefit) obligation to you will end. Alternatively, if you opt to keep your monthly benefits, nothing will change, except that the option to take a lump sum may be removed after the offer period expires.

The process is relatively simple, but the decision about which option to take can be complex. Here are some considerations for each option: Keeping the monthly payment Pension plans typically provide for the payment of a set amount every month from your retirement date for the rest of your life (""an annuity""). You may also choose to receive lifetime payments that continue to your spouse after your death.<sup>1</sup>

These monthly payments do have drawbacks, however:

 *  If you're no longer working for the company making the offer, your benefit amount typically will not increase between now and your retirement date. Furthermore, once you begin receiving life annuity payments, your payment amount typically will not come with inflation protection. As a result, your monthly benefits are likely to lose purchasing power over time. An annual inflation rate of 3%, the average since 1926, will cut the value of your benefit in half in 24 years.
 *  Taking your pension benefit as a life annuity means your ability to collect your payments depends in part on your company's ability to make them. If your company retains the pension and can't make the payments, a federal agency called the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) will pay a portion of them up to a legally defined limit. The maximum benefit guaranteed by the PBGC in 2020 is $5,812.50 per month (straight-life annuity) for most people retiring at age 65. The monthly guarantee is lower for retirees before age 65 and larger for those retiring after age 65. If responsibility for your payments shifts to an insurance company, it will be the insurance company and not the pension plan that is responsible for your guarantees.<sup>2</sup>

Some employers are also considering buying annuities for those who do not opt for the lump-sum offer. In this case, your benefits will not change, except that the insurance company's name will be on the checks you receive in retirement, and the guaranteed income will be provided by the insurance company.<sup>3</sup> (As with offering lump sums, companies that transfer the annuities to an insurance company can remove the pension liability from their books.) Taking the lump-sum payment A lump-sum payment may seem attractive. You give up the right to receive future monthly benefit payments in exchange for a cash-out payment now—typically, the actuarial net present value of your age-65 benefit, discounted to today. Taking the money up front gives you flexibility. You can invest it yourself, and if you have assets remaining at the time of your death, you can leave them to your heirs.

However, keep in mind the following cautionary factors:

 *  You are responsible for making the funds last throughout your retirement.
 *  Your investments may be subject to market fluctuation, which could increase or reduce the value of your assets and the income you can generate from them.
 *  The amount of a lump sum payment has an inverse relationship to interest rates—in general, as interest rates rise, lump sum values will decline.
 *  If you don't roll the proceeds directly into an IRA or an employer-qualified plan like a 401(k) or a 403(b), the distribution will be taxed as ordinary income and may push you into a higher tax bracket. If you take the distribution before age 59½, you may also owe a 10% early withdrawal tax penalty.
 *  You can use some or all of the lump sum to purchase an annuity—typically, an immediate annuity—which could provide a monthly income stream as well as inflation protection or other optional features built into the cost. But as an individual buyer, you may not be able to negotiate as good a deal with the insurance provider as the benefit you would have received by taking the pension plan annuity, so the annuity may or may not replicate the monthly pension payment you would have received from your employer. You also need to select your annuity provider carefully, paying special attention to a company's credit ratings, and make sure you read and understand the terms and conditions of the annuity. Making your choice Whether it's best to take a lump sum or keep your pension depends on your personal circumstances. You'll need to assess a number of factors, including those mentioned above and the following:

 *  **Your retirement income and essential expenses.** Guaranteed income, like Social Security, a pension, and fixed annuities, simply means something that you can count on every month or year and that doesn't vary with market and investment returns. If your guaranteed retirement income (including your income from the pension plan) and your essential expenses (such as food, housing, and health insurance) are roughly equivalent, the best choice may be to keep the monthly payments, because they play a critical role in meeting your essential retirement income needs. If your guaranteed income exceeds your essential expenses, you might consider taking the lump sum. You can use a portion of it to cover your monthly expenses, and invest the rest for growth.
    
    These comparisons may be relatively easy if you're already retired, but developing an accurate picture of your retirement income and expenses can be difficult if you're still working. Beware of the temptation to use the lump sum to pay down credit card debt or handle other current expenses—and not just because of the large tax bill you're likely to face. ""Lump-sum distributions come from a pool of money that is intended specifically for retirement,"" explains Beck. ""To access those funds for another reason puts the quality of your retirement at risk.""
 *  **Longevity.** Both your monthly benefit payment and the lump-sum amount were calculated using actuarial calculations that take into account your current age, mortality tables, and interest rates set forth by the IRS. But these estimates don't take into account your personal health history or the longevity of your parents, grandparents, or siblings. If you expect to have an above-average life span, you may want the predictability of regular payments. Having a payment stream that is guaranteed to last throughout your lifetime can be comforting. However, if you expect to have a shorter-than-average life span because of personal reasons like your family medical history, the lump sum could be more beneficial.
 *  **Wealth transfer plans.** After you've considered retirement income and expenses, and have planned an adequate cushion for inflation, longevity, and investment risk, it's appropriate to take wealth transfer plans into consideration. With pension plans, you often don't have the ability to transfer the benefit to children or grandchildren. Please consult an estate planning attorney. Moving forward A pension buyout should be evaluated within the context of your overall retirement picture. If you are presented with this option, consult an expert who can give you unbiased advice about your choices. Finally, be aware that more corporations continue to consider discharging their pension obligations, so it's a good idea to stay in touch with old employers. ""If you've left a pension behind at a former employer, sometime in the coming years, you're very likely to be offered a lump sum,"" says Beck. ""Keep your former employer's administrator up to date on your current address, because you can miss this opportunity if your employer can't find you."" Next steps  *  First and foremost, make sure you know whether you have any pension benefit at your current or former employers, and keep your contact information with those companies up to date. You cannot even consider an offer if you don't know it exists.
 *  Get a comprehensive view of your retirement plan with our [Planning & Guidance Center](http://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/calculators-tools/planning-guidance-center), and explore changes that may help you become better prepared.
 *  If you decide to take a lump sum in lieu of monthly pension payments, you may want to consider rolling it over to an IRA. A direct rollover from your employer's plan to your IRA provider (trustee to trustee) will not be subject to immediate taxation and may be the best way to preserve the tax-deferred status of this money. You should consult your tax adviser.

If you do receive a lump-sum payment offer, review it with a trusted financial adviser. Everyone's circumstances are different. What is right for your friend, neighbor, coworker, or relative may not be right for you."

 *  Be sure to discuss your plans with your family to avoid costly mistakes.
 *  There are many estate planning strategies for real estate to consider, including a revocable trust, transfer on death (TOD), qualified personal residence trust (QPRT), or other mechanisms.

For most families, a home is among their most valuable assets, both financially and emotionally. Primary homes and vacation homes are often the most complex parts of an estate plan. Few possessions are wrapped up in so much history and emotion, are worth so much money, and are so complicated to inherit.

""It is important to be thoughtful about how you are going to leave a home and to whom,"" says Terri Lyders, vice president of Advanced Planning at Fidelity. ""If there are issues between siblings, tax considerations, or other family needs to consider, the parent should make an informed decision about what to do with the house, and ensure that their estate plan reflects these wishes."" The need for planning While Fidelity encourages everyone to have a basic estate plan, there are a number of reasons it is particularly important to come up with a specific plan for a home or homes.

**Complex asset:** Compared with inheriting a stock or bank account, homeownership is complex, with ongoing costs and maintenance.

**Emotion:** Many homes come with lots of memories, or may be wrapped up in a family member's plan for their future or current living situation. That can make negotiating decisions about a home very tricky for siblings or others who inherit property.

**Illiquidity:** If the person who inherits the home doesn't want to keep ownership of it, they may incur legal fees, taxes, and other transaction costs. In addition, many states have estate tax exemption limits far below the federal level. If the value of the home exceeds that limit, the heir may face a state estate tax bill and may have insufficient funds to pay it. That could force a sale of the home or force the heir to seek financing options to pay the bill.

**Tax benefits:** An heir is granted a step-up in basis at the time of death—meaning that if they sell the house, it will be taxed based on the value at the time of death (or alternative valuation date, if allowed). But the tax advantage of the lower cost basis doesn't generally transfer to another family member (see sidebox). **Outstanding debt:** When there is an outstanding mortgage on the home, careful consideration needs to be given to how the debt will be handled when the home passes to the heirs. Most mortgages have a ""due on sale"" clause that may be triggered at death. If so, other liquid assets in the estate would need to be used to pay off the debt, the inheritor would need to qualify for a mortgage on their own, or the home would need to be sold.

To prepare for a smooth and efficient transfer of your home, start by thinking about your goals and your financial situation. First ask: What would you like to see happen with the house? For instance, does one of your children still live with you, and do you want to provide an option for them to stay in the house for some period of time? Do you have a vacation home you would like to see shared by future generations?

After understanding your goals, be sure to discuss your plan with your family. You need to be mindful that your children may have different ideas about whether they would want to live in, sell, or keep the property for investment purposes. It can be difficult to have these conversations, and you may want to have an advisor help facilitate the conversation, but it is very important.

""There may be assumptions, made either by a parent or by children, that aren't accurate. And when an estate plan is created based on an incorrect set of assumptions, it can create discord among family members,"" says Lyders.

For example, Lyders worked with a couple who was planning to leave a vacation home to their 2 children equally so that they could continue the long tradition of family vacations. But one child lived far away and already owned a vacation home in that area. Leaving the home equally would have created issues regarding maintenance cost, taxes, and upkeep. If the siblings decided not to share the house and executed a transfer of ownership, it might have increased taxes and created transaction costs. Disagreement on whether to continue shared ownership could also have caused hurt feelings and disrupted what was otherwise a good relationship. After having a family conversation, they realized shared inheritance didn't make sense.

""The best-case scenario is when parents make informed choices so the kids don't have to worry or make major changes after the inheritance, and they structure the transfer to be efficient and private,"" says Lyders. How to pass the home down There are a number of mechanisms to transfer ownership as part of an estate plan. Probate If you don't take any action and die without a will or having made any other arrangements, your assets will pass according to your state intestacy laws, which may or may not reflect your wishes. This will include going through probate—a process that is potentially expensive, public, slow, and complicated. There are a number of other ways to transfer ownership that can help manage these issues. Co-ownership—the deed One common idea that people have about passing the home to kids is seemingly simple: Just add the heirs as co-owners on the current deed.

If you list your child, children, or anyone else on the deed as joint tenants, they will become co-owners at the time you alter the deed and automatically take ownership of the home at the time of your death. So this approach does avoid some of the issues with probate.

There are some downsides to this approach, however. First of all, if you add children as co-owners, the portion you transferred is considered a taxable gift, so you have to report it for gift tax purposes. Say a single parent adds a child to the deed, the parent would need to report 50% of the value of the home as a taxable gift (based on the fair market value of the home at the time of the transfer). Secondly, gifts made during your lifetime are subject to carryover cost basis, meaning that, for tax purposes, your child takes on a cost basis equivalent to what yours was. Thus, the cost basis used for capital gains tax purposes doesn’t get a step-up at the time of death—instead, your child may get a larger tax bill on the portion of the house that you gave them during your lifetime, if they eventually sell the house after your death.

Finally, as co-owners, the home becomes an asset of your child, creating several potential issues. First, if your child runs into financial trouble, gets divorced, or has other issues, your home may be put under a lien or become subject to other action. Second, you would need your child's permission to sell the home, take out a new mortgage, or refinance an existing one. And finally, your child may decide they would like to sell the home, which can create challenges.

""While it seems simple, this usually is not the best solution from a planning perspective,"" says Lyders. Will You can use your will to pass your home on to your heirs. This process will ensure that you decide who inherits the property. However, assets that transfer through a will still pass through the probate process, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, your will is a public document, so anyone can review your assets and see who inherited them. Especially in this day of electronic access, that can create a privacy concern. Revocable trust A revocable trust is a legal structure that allows you (the ""grantor"" and ""trustee"") to retain control over your assets during your lifetime, as well as specify exactly how and when your assets pass to your beneficiaries. After your death, the trust acts as a will substitute and enables the trustee to privately and quickly distribute the assets owned by the trust without going through the time and expense of the probate process. Thus, you continue to have full control and use of your home during your lifetime while providing for efficient distribution at your death.

Due to the complexity of trusts and the variation in state-level rules, it is important to work with a professional to set up a trust, which costs money, but may be the only way to ensure that the trust works effectively. It is also important to remember that it may be necessary to change the titling of your assets for the trust to function as intended.

Finally, a trust may be particularly beneficial for families that own properties in more than one state. If you don't establish a trust, your estate may pass through probate in multiple states.

""For many of my clients, one of their main goals is to pass down assets to beneficiaries without probate, and so a revocable trust is a core component of their estate plans,"" says Lyders. Qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) A QPRT allows you to move a primary or vacation residence out of your estate at a reduced gift tax cost. With a QPRT, the home is transferred to the trust right away; however, you retain the right to live in the home for the duration of the trust. During that time, you are responsible for rent, maintenance, taxes, and other aspects of ownership. The trust has an end date after which ownership of the house is transferred to the beneficiary (generally children or a trust for their benefit) and the original owner no longer has the right to occupy the house (although a lease may be negotiated with the beneficiary).

In order for this strategy to be effective for tax purposes, you must outlive the term of the trust. Otherwise, if you die before the trust terminates, the value of the home is included as part of your taxable estate. While a QPRT may be used for a primary residence, it can be challenging for a person to lose the right to occupy their home, or pay rent to do so, and thus QPRTs may often be used for vacation homes.

Two big benefits of a QPRT include the reduced gift tax cost of the transfer (because you retain the right to live in the home for a period of time), and that the value of the home is frozen for estate tax purposes at the time the trust is created. This means that for estate tax purposes, the value of the home is established at the time it enters the trust—and future price appreciation won’t affect the estate's tax bill. For a family facing estate tax issues, this strategy may help to limit taxes in the event that the property value increases over time.

Note that property that is subject to a mortgage can be difficult to handle from a gift tax perspective, and therefore it is often suggested that any debt be paid off prior to the transfer to a QPRT. Beneficiary designation—a transfer on death (TOD) deed Some states offer a TOD designation on a deed which essentially names a beneficiary for that property. With a TOD designation, assets pass outside probate, so it's quick and private, and your heirs still get a step-up in basis for tax purposes. It may also be less expensive than setting up a trust.

There are some drawbacks to a TOD designation. It only allows you to name individuals or charities, so you don't have the ability to name a trustee under a trust. That means that if your children are still young at the time of the transfer, they would directly own the home, which may not be practical. There is also no contingency, so if you outlive a child who is named as a beneficiary, there is no provision to skip a generation and pass the asset to their children—you would need to update the TOD deed. Additionally, if you pass the home to an adult receiving government benefits, it could affect their eligibility.

TOD deed options are limited by state law, and many states do not offer this option at all. Check with your attorney or tax advisor to determine whether this option is available and would be appropriate for your circumstances. Selling If you don't think your children will want the home, you may want to consider selling it and renting a home later in your life. Issues like maintenance, health, and lifestyle may be more important than the financial considerations here, but be sure to consider the tax impact of this decision. Current tax law allows a married couple to exclude $500,000 of capital gains from the sale of a home, provided that they have lived there for 2 of the previous 5 years, and that the home meets the residency requirements. Gains above that amount are taxed. Inheriting a property comes with a step-up in basis, potentially eliminating capital gains tax. The bottom line A home can be the most valuable asset in an estate. It can also pose unique and emotional issues for a family. It's important to come up with a plan that makes sense for you, and your heirs, and to create an efficient strategy to execute it."
45,7697,January barometer,['Technical Analysis'],"['Active Trader Pro', 'Brokerage']","['Investing strategies', 'Market volatility', 'Markets']",['Stocks'],January barometer,January barometer,January barometer,How might stocks perform in 2020? Here's what this indicator says.,How might stocks perform in 2020? Here's what this indicator says.,How might stocks perform in 2020? Here's what this indicator says.," A widely followed market theory, popularized by *The Stock Trader's Almanac*, claims that as January goes, so goes the full year. With a down January 2020 in the books, one interpretation of this indicator says investors may want to exercise caution for the rest of the year. But there are reasons to take the January barometer with a grain of salt. Momentum halted 2019's bullish momentum for global stock markets appeared to have carried into 2020, at least through the first half of January. But global concerns—including the potential impact of the [ongoing Coronavirus scare](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/global-health-and-stocks)—have negatively impacted stocks. Indeed, the MSCI World Index and the S&P 500 lost 1% through the end of January (see **After a 28% gain in 2019, US stocks fell in January 2020** chart). So, does this year's 1% January loss point to a down year for US stocks? Not necessarily.

Momentum is one of the primary reasons why some investors give credence to indicators like the January barometer. The thought process here is that a bullish (or bearish) start will set the market in that direction for the rest of the year. For example, a 2% gain for the S&P 500 in January 2017 preceded the 19% full-year rally during that year, and an 8% January gain in 2019 concluded with a 28% rally last year. Of course, this pattern doesn't always hold: The S&P 500 lost 6% in 2018 after gaining 6% in January of that year. A bullish start is the stronger predictor Based solely on the past performance of the US market, an up January has generally been bullish for stocks. That has been particularly the case when the market has gained more than 5% in January. The January barometer has held true roughly 75% of the time when January experienced market gains since 1945. Notable exceptions followed extended periods of market growth.

It's worth noting that a down January has not been a reliable predictor of an overall weak year. Thus, the down start to 2020 may not be indicative of a down year overall. Of course, historical trends are not a guarantee of what will happen in the future, and there are a myriad of other, more important fundamental factors to consider, including valuations, earnings strength, and fiscal and monetary policy, among others. Cracks in the barometer Why might up Januaries be better predictors than down ones? One reason may be the historical proclivity of stocks to rise. US stocks have finished higher in all but 17 out of 73 years since 1945. So, the fact that stocks finish higher for the year so often after both a positive and negative January may simply be the result of this directional bias.

Indeed, there is a strong correlation between positive January S&P 500 performance and positive market performance for the entire year. During only 2 years since 1945 have stocks dropped sharply (a price decline of more than 10% for the full calendar year) after a positive January, with both instances occurring at the end of powerful multiyear market advances (1966 and 2001).

Moreover, a down January may not be a reliable predictor of a weak year overall. Going back to 1950, in 12 out of 26 years when January finished in the red, the stock market actually ended higher, and often by a very substantial amount.

As previously mentioned, momentum is one possible reason that positive stock performance during January can result in positive full-year performance. If the market gets off to a good start, a bullish trading pattern can form, and that can help fuel continued positive performance as investors jump on the trend.

From a historical perspective, there appears to be no clear evidence as to why a negative start does not more strongly imply a negative year, compared with the high correlation of a positive January translating to a positive year. The full-year outcome after a negative January (or a positive January, for that matter) may simply be spurious. First 5 days In addition to the January barometer, some market watchers place particular emphasis on the first 5 trading days of January as an indicator of where the market is headed for the full year. The first 5 trading days of this year saw US stocks add 1.4%, pointing toward a potentially positive year for the market, according to this indicator. In 2019, a 2.7% gain during the first 5 days culminated in the aforementioned 28% full-year gain.

But you need only look to a couple of years ago to see the cracks in this theory. During 2018, stocks gained 2.8% during the first 5 days before finishing the year in the red. One interesting recent occurrence where the first 5 days theory proved particularly unreliable was when stocks shed 4.8% during the first 5 days in 2016, the worst start ever on record. That ended up not being predictive, as stocks rebounded by that year's end.

A major problem with this theory is that the sample size of trading days is small (5), compared with the January barometer (typically about 20—which is also not a large sample size), to be a reliable predictor of the rest of the year. Given the small number of trading days associated with the first 5 days theory, there does not seem to be enough time for momentum to become a significant factor. Investing implications While it is impossible to predict the future, proponents of the January barometer think this indicator may provide some indication of how stocks will perform.

However, some of the evidence is not entirely conclusive. Additionally, each year is unique, as the factors impacting the market are constantly changing. For example, investors will likely be focusing on the scale of the Coronavirus scare, in addition to earnings, central bank moves, and important elections in the US.

Many investors like following the January barometer because it provides an easily identified outcome. But beware: Crafting a strategy solely on this theory, or any other technical theory or fundamental indicator, is not prudent."
46,8407,Tax reform and retirees,['Taxes'],,"['Income tax', 'Required minimum distributions', 'Social Security', 'Taxes']","['IRA', 'RMD Calculator', 'Social Security Benefits Calculator']",Tax reform and retirees,Will tax reform help retirees?,Tax reform and retirees,New tax deduction and rate rules may mean lower taxes for many retirees.,The new tax law may mean lower federal income tax bills for many retirees.,New tax deduction and rate rules may mean lower taxes for many retirees.," Key takeaways  *  Retirees may benefit from higher standard deductions and lower tax rates.
 *  The rules for required minimum distributions, Social Security taxes, and charitable IRA distributions have not changed.
 *  Some deductions have been eliminated or altered. If you are retired and thinking about your tax situation, you may wonder what last year's tax reform will mean for you. Most of the changes from the tax law went into effect in 2018. The new tax brackets, tax rates, rules for itemized deductions could all impact retirees. At the same time, the law left the rules for capital gains, tax loss harvesting, Social Security, and required distributions unchanged. Will senior citizens still get a higher standard deduction? Perhaps the most important tax rule change for many retirees will be the increase in the standard deduction. For older taxpayers who don’t carry a mortgage and have limited deductions, that standard deduction is often more valuable than itemized deductions. That will be the case for even more people, as the tax law roughly doubled the size of the standard deduction.

At the same time, the additional standard deduction for the elderly will still be available. In 2017, the tax rules allowed individual tax filers over age 65 to claim an additional standard deduction of $1,550, and married couples over the age of 65 could increase their standard deduction by $2,500. The new rules would increase these higher standard deductions for people over age 65 to $1,600 per individual and $2,600 per couple.

On the other hand, the new tax code eliminated personal exemptions. Still, many retirees may come out ahead due to the higher standard deduction, rate cuts, and other changes (see case studies below).

The new rules would not change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Under current and future laws, Social Security benefits are subject to federal income taxes above certain levels of combined income (see table below). Combined income generally consists of your [adjusted gross income (AGI)](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income), nontaxable interest, and one-half of your Social Security benefits.

What has changed are the applicable tax brackets—the new law lowered most tax rates and adjusted the income thresholds for the different tax brackets ([get details](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/PF/tax_lanscape_2019_chart_2.jpg)). So the taxes paid on the same Social Security benefit could be lower.

The existing rules for IRA distributions to charity have not changed. If you are over age 70½, you may distribute up to $100,000 per year directly to charity from your IRA, and the IRS will count that money as a [qualified charitable distribution](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/building-savings/learn-about-iras/required-minimum-distributions/qcds). The IRS will not include the funds as taxable income, but the distribution can satisfy your required minimum distribution (RMD). What happens to the deduction for medical expenses? The new tax rules preserve the deduction for medical expenses, and for the 2017 and 2018 tax years the AGI threshold for that deduction will be lowered from 10% of AGI to 7.5%. That could make this deduction available to more people with significant health issues. In 2019, the threshold will revert to 10% of AGI.

At the same time, the higher standard deduction may make this deduction irrelevant for many people, because the standard deduction may be greater than their total itemized deductions, which would include the itemized deduction for medical expenses. Do the taxes on investment gains and investment income change? The short answer is no, the same rules exist for short- and long-term capital gains, qualified and ordinary dividends, and interest income. The rules for tax losses are left unchanged.

However, the tax rates have changed. Short-term capital gains, ordinary dividends, and interest income from most bonds are generally taxed at ordinary income tax rates, so those rates will change along with the new tax brackets ([get details](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/PF/tax_lanscape_2019_chart_2.jpg)). **Hypothetical case studies – the new rules in action**
Here are some simplified case studies to see how these changes may play out.

**Higher standard deduction**
Let’s take a hypothetical couple over age 65 that has already been claiming the standard deduction. Their income included pension payments worth $12,000 a year, and an RMD of $50,000 from a traditional IRA and $24,000 a year from Social Security.

Because their combined income exceeds $44,000, 85% of their $24,000 Social Security benefit is taxable, equal to $20,400.

Their itemized deductions include charitable contributions, state and local taxes, and investment interest expenses totaling $11,000. In 2017, the couple opted for the standard deduction of $12,700, plus the additional standard deduction for the elderly of $2,500, and the personal exemptions totaling $8,100.

In 2017, the couple had a marginal tax rate of 15% and had to pay income taxes on $59,100 of income. In 2017, the federal income tax bill would have been $7,933.

Assuming the same income and deductions, in 2018 the couple would again use the standard deductions and additional deduction for the elderly, but those are now worth $24,000 and $2,600, respectively. The personal exemptions are no longer available.

The increased deductions reduce the income they are taxed on to $55,800. And tax reform lowered the tax rates—they are now in the 12% marginal tax bracket. So their new tax bill is $6,315. That’s a tax cut of about $1,600, or about 20%.

**No longer itemizing**
Let's look at a hypothetical higher-income couple over age 65 that had itemized their tax returns. This couple earns $50,000 a year from Social Security, withdraws $120,000 a year from a traditional IRA, and still earns $20,000 a year from a position on a board. Their total income was $190,000. Only 85% of Social Security was taxable, or $42,500.

Their mortgage interest, charitable giving, and local tax deductions totaled $18,000.

In 2017, the couple claimed the personal exemption of $8,100 and itemized deductions worth $18,000, a total of $26,100. That left $156,400 in income, a marginal tax rate of 28%, and a tax bill of $30,676.

In 2018, the new standard deduction would be worth more than the itemized deductions, and the personal exemption is gone. The standard deductions would total $26,600, leaving them with $155,900 in income, but the tax brackets changed and they would now have a marginal income tax bracket of 22%, and a tax bill of $26,177. That’s a tax cut of $4,499, or 15%. The bottom line The tax law changed a large number of rules, but many of the provisions most important to retirees were unaffected. Many retirees will see their tax bill go down, but not everyone. The complex changes will affect individuals differently, so be sure to consult a tax advisor."

 *  Consider the costs of a conversion: how you would pay for it, the 3.8% Medicare surtax, and gains on company stock in a 401(k). The tax benefits of a Roth IRA are clear: Tax-free growth potential and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.<sup>1</sup> If you aren't able to contribute to a Roth IRA because of the income limits,<sup>2</sup> a Roth conversion of eligible retirement accounts is another way to have a Roth account.<sup>3</sup> But does it make sense if you are retired or within 15 years or so of retirement? Maybe. A Roth IRA, even via a conversion, has the potential to benefit your retirement and legacy planning.

While your situation is unique and should be discussed with a tax advisor, here are 7 things to keep in mind when thinking about a conversion. 1. Where you will live in retirement Are you planning to move to another state after you retire? Even if you expect your federal tax rate to stay the same in the coming years, the difference between your current and future state's tax rates may matter. And some states partially or entirely exclude retirement income—such as distributions from a traditional IRA—from state income tax. So if you live in, or plan to live in, a state that does, a conversion from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may be less attractive.

If your future state of residence has a higher state income tax rate than that of your current one, it might make sense to convert at least some of your eligible assets to a Roth IRA before you move. Similarly, if you're moving from a state with a higher tax rate to one with a lower rate—or no income tax—you may want to avoid a conversion, or at least consider waiting to convert until you've established your new residency. 2. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) Roth IRAs do not have [required minimum distributions](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/building-savings/learn-about-iras/required-minimum-distributions/overview) during the life of the original owner. But traditional IRAs and, generally, Roth and traditional 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and other employer-sponsored retirement savings plans do, starting at age 72<sup>4</sup>. If you don't need the income from these distributions to meet current retirement expenses, RMDs may feel like a nuisance: They need to be calculated each year, may provide unnecessary taxable income, and, if you miss taking one, can result in stiff penalties. And if you reinvest your RMDs in a taxable account, you are potentially reducing your after-tax return compared with what you'd receive if the money remained in the tax-advantaged traditional or Roth IRA.

A conversion of some or all other eligible amounts to a Roth IRA will reduce or eliminate your need to take RMDs and may also allow you to pass more of your retirement account savings on to your heirs (see No. 4). It may be advantageous to convert before you turn age 72, since you will otherwise be required to take RMDs before any conversions.

Consider this hypothetical example: Mark, 75, had $100,000 in a traditional IRA at the end of last year. His wife, Ann, the sole beneficiary of his IRA, is 6 years younger than he is. Mark's RMD for the year would be $4,367.<sup>5</sup> If Mark didn't need this money, a Roth conversion of the assets remaining in the traditional IRA could allow him to avoid successively larger RMDs in the years ahead, and provide an opportunity for his money to grow tax-free instead. Of course, Mark would need to factor in the tax payment triggered from a conversion to see if this strategy makes sense for his situation (see No. 7). 3. The 3.8% Medicare surtax Married couples (filing jointly) with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of more than $250,000 may be subject to a 3.8% Medicare surtax. (The MAGI thresholds are $125,000 for married taxpayers filing separately and $200,000 for single filers.) The surtax applies to net investment income (which includes income from interest, dividends, capital gains, annuities, rents, and royalties, among other things); or MAGI in excess of the income thresholds, whichever is less.

The amount you convert from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is treated as income—just like all taxable distributions from pretax qualified accounts. Therefore the conversion amount is part of your MAGI, and it may move you above the surtax thresholds. This may cause you to incur the additional Medicare surtax on your investment income.

For more information on this, read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [6 key Medicare questions](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/understanding-medicare-options)

But, once your money is in a Roth IRA, the shoe is on the other foot. Because nontaxable withdrawals from a Roth IRA aren't part of your MAGI, a Roth IRA conversion may potentially enable you to limit your exposure to the Medicare surtax down the road. 4. Leaving money to others If you're planning to leave retirement savings to heirs, consider how it may affect their taxes. Because of their RMDs, inherited traditional IRAs generate taxable income for heirs, often during their peak earning years. These distributions could incur taxes when they'd rather avoid them, or unintentionally push them into a higher tax bracket. Inheriting Roth IRA assets, which generally don't incur any income taxes, can be a benefit to your heirs. In addition, the income taxes paid on a Roth IRA conversion may also help reduce the size of a taxable estate.

But there are many details to consider. For example, if your heirs are likely to be in a much lower tax bracket than you are, it may be advantageous to leave them a traditional IRA. That's because it may be better for them to pay lower taxes in the future than for you to pay higher taxes now.

Also, Roth IRA conversions may be disadvantageous to those who intend to leave at least some of their assets to charitable institutions. Traditional IRAs can typically be left to charity without any tax bill at all for either party. So, in that case, conversion will mean that the tax was paid needlessly.<sup>6</sup>

If leaving money to others is part of your plan, no matter what your goals are, be sure to consult an estate planning attorney and think carefully before taking any action.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [An all-in-one wealth transfer checklist](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/wealth-transfer-checklist) 5. Workplace retirement plan options There are 2 different workplace retirement programs to consider when planning the timing and size of a Roth conversion: company stock options and the Roth 401(k) option.

If you're retiring and have appreciated company stock in your traditional 401(k) or other qualified workplace savings plan, it may not make sense to convert these assets to a Roth IRA. Special tax rules on net unrealized appreciation (NUA), if you qualify, allow you to take a lump-sum distribution from your plan, and pay income tax (and a 10% penalty, if you're under age 59½) on your cost basis. You can then defer taxes on the NUA—that is, the appreciation of the stock since you bought it—until you sell the stock. At that time, the NUA would be taxable as long-term capital gains. This will probably cost you less than having it taxed as ordinary income, as it would be in a Roth IRA conversion.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Make the most of company stock](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/company-stock) Roth 401(k) option If you're still working, you are not typically allowed to do a Roth IRA rollover from your 401(k) or 403(b). However, you may consider 2 options: Contribute to your company’s Roth 401(k) if offered by your employer, or do an in-plan conversion to a Roth 401(k). Not all employers offer in-plan conversions, and, even when they do, a Roth 401(k) lacks a few of the features of a Roth IRA. Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s are subject to RMDs. But, if you are unable to convert to a Roth IRA, the Roth 401(k) option may be worth exploring. This is especially true for those who have made after-tax contributions (also called nonqualified contributions) to their 401(k) plan. The key is to discuss your situation with a tax and financial advisor to help you fully assess the decision. 6. College-age children If you have children who are currently in—or are close to starting—college, and who are applying for financial aid, a Roth IRA conversion may have an impact. Because the amount converted is treated as income, it's included in the needs test on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and can potentially raise a parent's expected financial contribution (EFC) and reduce aid. If you request it, some universities may adjust their calculation to account for Roth IRA conversion income in their private financial aid formulas, but federal aid formulas do not. So if you're seeking financial aid, especially federal, it may make sense to wait to convert until your children are out of college.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [3 ""must-know"" college financial aid tips](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/3-savvy-financial-aid-tips) 7. How you would pay for the conversion A Roth IRA conversion has a cost, which is the income taxes on the amount you convert. It generally makes sense to use taxable assets rather than proceeds from a converted account to pay the tax cost of a Roth IRA conversion. This is because, all things being equal, the rate of return is generally higher for a Roth IRA because no taxes are due for any gains in a Roth IRA—and taxes reduce the returns you achieve. Consequently, it usually makes sense to pay for a conversion with the assets that will earn a lower *after-tax* return (taxable assets already outside of the Roth IRA). This is particularly true for those under age 59½, because, for them, paying for a conversion using proceeds from a qualified account could also result in a 10% tax penalty and further reduce the potential benefit of converting.

Consider this hypothetical example: Elaine is 62 and has $100,000 (all pretax) in a traditional IRA and $25,000 in a brokerage account. Her current marginal tax rate is 25% and she expects it to remain there. What would she have after 5 years if she converts her traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and uses proceeds to pay the taxes? How would that compare with using money from her brokerage account to pay for the conversion? (To keep it simple, the example assumes investment returns of 5% compounded annually in the Roth IRA, 4% compounded annually in the brokerage account after accounting for federal income taxes, and does not take state income taxes and other tax considerations or inflation into account.) If Elaine uses money from her brokerage account to pay taxes on the conversion, she could wind up with nearly $1,500 more in her Roth IRA after 5 years. That's because returns on money in the brokerage account are reduced by taxes (for example, taxes on dividend and interest distributions), while returns on money in her Roth IRA are not—they earn a pretax rate of return. So, using the brokerage account to pay for the taxes due from the conversion means her remaining assets in the Roth IRA earn the higher, pretax rate of return. Using conversion proceeds to pay the taxes means that less of her total assets earn the higher, pretax rate of return.

If Elaine could use money from a bank account rather than from a brokerage account to pay for the conversion, that would tend to make the benefit even larger, because bank accounts typically offer lower rates of return than brokerage accounts. If Elaine's investment horizon were longer than 5 years, that too would increase the benefit of using assets other than proceeds from the IRA to pay for conversion. That said, always consider the broader context: If, for example, the money in the bank account is your emergency fund, using it for a Roth conversion may not be appropriate, despite the benefits.

Ways to withdraw money in retirement It's official: You're retired. That probably means no more regular paycheck, and that you may need to turn to your investments for income. But remember—the impact of taxes is just as important to consider now as it was when saving for retirement.

The good news is that in retirement there may be more options to increase after-tax income, especially when savings span multiple account types, such as traditional retirement accounts, Roth accounts, and taxable savings like brokerage or savings accounts. The not-so-good news is that choosing which accounts to draw from and when can be a complicated decision.

""Many people are seeking ways to help reduce the taxes that they will pay over the course of their retirement,"" says Andrey Lyalko, vice president of Fidelity financial solutions. ""Timing is critical. So, how and when you choose to withdraw from various accounts—401(k)s, Roth accounts, and other accounts—can impact your taxes in different ways."" Finding the right withdrawal strategy Let's start with a key question that many retirees ask: How long will my money last in my retirement?

As a starting point, Fidelity suggests you consider withdrawing no more than 4-5% from your savings in the first year of retirement, and then increase that first year's dollar amount annually by the inflation rate. But from which accounts should you be taking that money?

Traditionally, many advisors have suggested withdrawing first from taxable accounts, then tax deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts where withdrawals are tax free (see illustration below). The goal: to allow tax-deferred assets to grow longer and faster.

For most people with multiple retirement saving accounts and relatively even retirement income year over year, a better approach might be proportional withdrawals. Once a target amount is determined, an investor would withdraw from every account based on that account’s percentage of their overall savings.

The effect is a more stable tax bill over retirement, and potentially lower lifetime taxes and higher lifetime after-tax income. To get started, consider these 2 simple strategies that can help you get more out of your retirement savings, depending on your personal situation. Traditional approach: Withdrawals from one account at a time To help get a clearer picture of how this could work, let's take a look at a hypothetical example: Joe is 62 and single. He has $200,000 in taxable accounts, $250,000 in traditional 401(k) accounts and IRAs, and $50,000 in a Roth IRA. He receives $25,000 per year in Social Security and has a total after-tax income need of $60,000 per year. Let's assume a 5% annual return.

If Joe takes a traditional approach, withdrawing from one account at a time, starting with taxable, then traditional and finally Roth, his savings will last slightly more than 22 years and he will pay an estimated $74,000 in taxes throughout his retirement. Note that with the traditional approach, Joe hits an abrupt ""tax bump"" (see red circle in chart) in year 8 where he pays over $5,000 in taxes for 11 years while paying nothing for the first 7 years and nothing when he starts to withdraw from his Roth account. Proportional withdrawals Now let's consider the proportional approach. As you can see in the graph above, this strategy spreads out and dramatically reduces the tax impact, thereby extending the life of the portfolio from slightly more than 22 years to slightly more than 23 years. ""This approach provides Joe an extra year of retirement income and costs him only $46,000 in taxes over the course of his retirement. That's a reduction of almost 40% in total taxes paid on his income in retirement,"" explains Lyalko. By spreading out taxable income more evenly over retirement, you may also be able to potentially reduce the taxes you pay on Social Security benefits and the premiums you pay on Medicare. Expecting relatively large long-term capital gains? Spreading traditional IRA withdrawals out over the course of retirement lifetime may make sense for many people. However, if an investor anticipates having a relatively large amount of long-term capital gains from your investments—enough to reach the 15% long term capital gain bracket threshold—there may be a more beneficial strategy: First use up taxable accounts, then take the remaining withdrawals proportionally.

The purpose of this strategy is to take advantage of zero or low long-term capital gains rates, if available based on ordinary income tax brackets. Tax rates on long-term capital gains (applied to assets that are held over 1 year) are 0%, 15% or 20% depending on taxable income and filing status (see tables). Assuming no income besides capital gains, and filing single, the total capital gains would need to exceed $38,600 before taxes would be owed. One strategy for retirees to help reduce taxes is to take capital gains when they are in the lower tax brackets. For example, single filers with taxable income less than $38,600, are in the 2 lower tax brackets. That equates to a 0% tax on capital gains. If taxable income is between $38,601 and $425,800, long-term capital gains rate is 15%. Remember, the amount of ordinary income impacts long-term capital gain tax rates.

Meet Jamie, a hypothetical single filer with $21,525 in ordinary income and $5,000 in long-term capital gains. After taking advantage of the $12,000 standard deduction, she will have $9,525 ($21,525 - $12,000) subject to a 10% income tax, but her $5,000 in capital gains will be taxed at 0%. Estimated total tax due: $953.

Now meet David, a hypothetical single filer who has $50,601 in ordinary income and $5,000 in long-term capital gains. After taking out $12,000 in standard deduction; his first $9,525 of taxable income will be taxed at 10%, the remaining $29,076 of ordinary income at 12%, and, because of his higher income tax bracket, the $5,000 in long-term capital gains will be taxed at 15% or $750. His estimated total tax due: $5,192.

The big difference: Jamie pays zero on her long-term capital gains because her income is below that key threshold of $38,600, but David pays 15% on his $5,000 because of his higher earnings. Investors that can take advantage of the 0% long term capital gain rate may want to consider using their taxable account first to meet expenses. Once the taxable account is exhausted, the proportional approach can then be applied.

Additionally, this strategy allows investors to keep their assets in more tax-efficient accounts for a longer period of time by delaying withdrawing from their traditional and Roth accounts where the assets can grow tax-deferred or tax-exempt, respectively. Plan ahead Optimizing withdrawals in retirement is a complex process that requries a firm understanding of tax situations, financial goals, and how accounts are structured. However, the 2 simple strategies highlighted here could potentially help reduce the amount of tax due in retirement.

It's important to take the time to think about taxes and make a plan to manage withdrawals. Be sure to consult with a tax or financial advisor to determine the course of action that makes sense for you."

| Forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP) growth may offer insight into how stock markets and bond yields could fare in the future.  Population and productivity trends may slow global GDP growth over the next 20 years.  Slower growth could mean lower-than-average interest rates and lower stock market returns than in recent decades. |  | Over the past 20 years, the global economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2.7% thanks to a variety of factors including rising globalization, advances in information technology, and increased trade. That growth has been accompanied by strong performances from both equity and fixed income markets. During the next 20 years, though, Lisa Emsbo-Mattingly, Dirk Hofschire, and Irina Tytell of Fidelity’s Asset Allocation Research Team predict that global GDP growth will slow to an average of 2.1% annually with potential consequences for financial markets. They base their forecast on productivity and population data from 40 countries and they cite demographic trends including aging populations in developed economies as a key factor that will slow growth. They also predict that the rapid growth rates that Asia's emerging market countries have enjoyed in recent decades may become more difficult to sustain as their pace of rapid industrialization slows.

Slower growth is not the same as declining growth, however, and the global economy is still likely to expand over the next 20 years. The US should average roughly 1.6% annualized growth and narrowly retain its status as the world's largest economy. Emerging economies will likely grow faster and account for a greater portion of global growth over the next 20 years. These countries are projected to comprise about half of global GDP by 2038, compared with about 40% now and one-quarter 20 years ago. This should help offset weaker outlooks for Japan and many European countries. Why growth may slow Economic growth results from increases in the number of people working and in the amount of output those workers produce. A country's labor force participation rate has the most direct impact on GDP growth. This statistic reflects the number of working age people who live there and the percentage of them who are either working or seeking work. In advanced economies, longer lifespans and low birthrates are producing aging populations that tend to lower labor force participation rates over time. Labor force growth rose rapidly over the past several decades, but developed economies such as Japan and parts of Europe are likely to see their labor forces shrink over the next 20 years as people live longer and birth rates remain low.

While predicting population trends that affect GDP is relatively easy, making predictions about productivity is more complicated. For most of world history, productivity grew extremely slowly and economies generally expanded in line with their populations’ growth. At the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1820, the largest economies were China and India, which also had the largest populations. After that, technological innovation powered rapid productivity gains and by 1900, the US was the world’s largest economy, despite having only one-fifth as many people as China. Some economic forecasters believe the US possesses an inherent dynamism that will maintain this type of high productivity growth over the next 20 years, perhaps boosted by artificial intelligence, robotics, and other technologies. Others believe the era of strong productivity growth is ending. They point out that per capita income has stagnated in the US and other developed economies, while technology seems less transformative than before. For instance, recent advances—such as mobile connectivity—have yielded consumer luxuries such as new smartphone apps rather than revolutionary innovations. Fidelity's analysts believe both perspectives suffer from a narrow focus on the US and do not reflect a global economy in which emerging countries account for more than one-third of output. Instead, they forecast productivity growth by looking at 3 proven drivers of productivity, which they call human capital, structure and catch-up potential.

Human capital reflects the educational and scientific achievements of a nation’s people, and the higher the human capital, the more productive its economy. Human capital tends to be greatest in the US, Japan, and northern Europe. South Korea also has a high human capital ranking and emerging economies including China, Indonesia, and Malaysia have made great strides over the past 20 years. This accumulation of human capital over the past 2 decades should boost global growth in the next 20 years.

Structurally complex economies are those that produce a variety of sophisticated products. They tend to be competitive, use technology effectively, possess healthy business climates and institutions, and are highly productive. Fidelity’s researchers believe that the increasing complexity of emerging economies such as South Korea, Malaysia, and China will contribute slightly to higher global growth over the next 20 years.

An additional driver of productivity growth is the ability of less-developed countries to grow quickly from low levels of development, adopt existing technologies, and catch up to the higher income levels of developed countries. This catch-up potential will likely contribute much less to future global growth than it has over the past 2 decades as economies such as China, India, and South Korea will have less catch-up potential in the next 20 years than they did in the past. Why GDP matters for investors Economic growth has a profound influence on corporate earnings, interest rates, inflation, and many other factors that affect the long-term performance of financial markets. Slower global growth may mean less support for stock market returns over the next 20 years than has existed since the end of World War II. Emerging market stocks and the stocks of companies with significant exposure to emerging market consumers may fare better if growth is concentrated in emerging economies, but that growth may prove to be unevenly distributed across emerging markets. Slower growth will also matter for bond investors if interest rates rise gradually from their current levels but remain lower than their historical averages.

To be sure, while GDP forecasts can provide guidance for investors seeking to set realistic expectations for future returns from their portfolios, other factors such as stock market leverage and valuation dynamics will also play a role in how stocks perform. For bonds, GDP growth has a tight, positive relationship with interest rates, yet fixed income investors should also bear in mind starting yields and other considerations. It’s also important to remember that the cyclical expansion and contraction of the business cycle will also move markets over the shorter term.

As someone—perhaps Yankee catcher Yogi Berra, maybe film producer Samuel Goldwyn or possibly physicist Niels Bohr—famously said, ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" However, those investors whose portfolios are well diversified across a broad, global opportunity set may be best positioned to take advantage of future growth, slower though it may be."

 *  Ask for help if you need it. You can find saving motivation and inspiration in your social circle or you can get a financial coach to keep you on track. You probably have many plans for your money. Just paying bills, eating, and keeping a roof over your head may take up a lot of your monthly income. Not to mention insurance and transportation. Then there are important longer-term goals like saving for travel or a down payment on a house—and, of course, putting money away for retirement and emergencies.

Striking a balance can be a struggle. If you could use a little help, here's a quick guide to enjoying life without sacrificing your financial future. Create a financial plan Think broadly at first: Start with your goals. There's a good chance you know some of the things you want to work on—maybe it's paying off debt or beginning to save more for a house or your retirement.

The tricky part is often taking the first step. To make the process manageable, it helps to think of your finances in sections—and then set small goals for each. For instance, we like to start with these 4 tiers: budgeting, debt management, saving and investing, and protecting what you have. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  |

For example, we suggest saving 3–6 months' worth of essential expenses in an emergency fund. That's a lot of money and can take a while. But saving $1,000 for emergencies while you continue to build your savings and live your life is easier to accomplish.

Making sure each of your 4 tiers is as strong as possible is the ultimate goal. The tiers are all interconnected—if one piece of your financial foundation is unsteady, it may not take much to throw off your entire plan. The areas you start with will depend on your unique situation; including where you're starting from and where you want to go in the future. Implement: Make your plan a reality Knowing what needs to be done is half the battle. But you may also need specific strategies to help put your plan into action.

For instance, not everyone is a born saver—it can be a challenge to manage day-to-day spending or pay off debt. Mastering your budget could free up more money to save for the future and help pay down credit cards and loans. If you’re able to, increasing the amount you save by as little as 1% can have a huge impact over time.

A strong foundation of budgeting, debt management, saving, and insurance can help you achieve big, long-term savings goals, like retirement or funding a child's education. But investing is a key component in a long-term plan as well. Investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and short-term investments can help your money grow and potentially get you to your goals faster than saving alone.

But it does take time—that's why getting invested as soon as possible is often one of the first steps in a financial plan. An investment mix tailored to your goals and time frame, your financial needs, and your feelings about investment risk can help find the balance between risk and reward that's right for you.

Investing is important for long-term growth, but you have to be able to stick with it through the market’s ups and downs. Having a plan that's built for the long haul and customized to your needs and preferences can help you do it. Monitor and manage The financial planning process never really ends—it should be ongoing. After putting your plan into action, it may be useful to check in at regular intervals to gauge how much progress has been made. You should be able to find out where you stand now relative to your goals and see what else needs to be done. As your life changes, your plan can change too. Any big developments like getting married or divorced, having a baby or adopting, or a change to your employment could require updates to your plan.

Investment monitoring and rebalancing are important components of this step as well. After all, markets change and may result in you taking on more risk than you are comfortable with—or not enough. A good rule of thumb is to review your asset mix and investments at least annually, and make adjustments as needed. Plan for the future and live in the moment Organizing your full financial picture may take time but it’s worth it. Before you begin, it can seem overwhelming. Taking action and working through the process one step at a time can help you feel in control and confident that you’re making the most of your money."

 *  A one-on-one relationship with an advisor is not just about money management. A financial advisor can help provide ongoing financial planning so you can have peace of mind while pursuing your life goals.
 *  The financial planning process includes defining your goals, understanding your current situation, and identifying the key steps to move forward.
 *  Beyond long-term goals like retirement, and shorter-term ones like buying a house, education, or travel, holistic financial planning can also include legacy planning, family support, health care, insurance, and charitable giving. When we make big decisions in life, most of us look for a source of expertise and guidance to help us make thoughtful choices to meet our individual goals and needs.

That's what professional financial advice is all about. Ongoing financial planning can pay off in many ways. Industry studies estimate that financial advice can add between 1.5% and 4% to account growth over extended periods.<sup>1</sup>

Of course, the value of advice varies greatly. For one thing, financial advice can mean very different things to different people. For some investors, online financial planning tools or a single investment solution may meet their needs. For others, including people with more wealth, complex situations, or those who put more value on having a personal advisor, a one-on-one relationship with a financial advisor may be a better fit. In addition, the value of financial advice will vary over different time periods, depending on the personal circumstances, market conditions, and more.

For most investors who choose to work with an advisor, advice is not just about investments. More than half of all investors said that ongoing financial planning and coaching services were the most valuable part of their advisor relationship. In this special report, we bring some aspects of an ongoing financial planning relationship to life through Sally and Ben, a hypothetical couple.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Sally and Ben](/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/II/sally_ben375w.jpg) | **Sally & Ben** **Age:** 55 **Savings and investments:** $1,000,000 **Income:** $250,000 per year (total) **Goals:** Support their son, maintain lifestyle during retirement, leave a legacy to a local charity | Plan Everyone has goals and an advisor can work with you to understand those goals, model and quantify your options, confirm the steps you are taking and illustrate alternative plans to get you there. Over time, holistic planning may include retirement, housing, education, travel, family support, charity, and more. Sally and Ben's financial planning When Sally and Ben first met with their advisor, he coached them to focus their attention on their major goals—and where they stood on the road to realizing them. Sally and Ben were considering how to help their 24-year-old son, create income in retirement, and manage the impact of taxes. Their advisor worked with Sally and Ben to create a picture of their current financial situation, helping them pull together all needed documents and to develop a balance sheet. Sally and Ben and their advisor agreed to an agenda of items they would tackle as next steps.

At the next meeting they reviewed their balance sheet, beneficiary designations, asset allocation, and progress toward their goals. Their advisor used financial assumptions and the details of their situation to project their current cash flow and get a sense of their retirement planning.

During their initial conversation, they were surprised to discover that Sally wanted to retire with Ben at age 62 while Ben was expecting both to work until age 67. Ben and Sally learned, according to the hypothetical projections, that by retiring at age 62 there was about a 10% probability they could run out of money by 2052, when they’d be 89 years old. While that level of risk might have been acceptable to some, both Sally and Ben have a family history of long lives, and the couple wasn't comfortable with this risk that they would outlive their savings.

Instead, by waiting until age 67 to retire, they’d have more years of savings and compounded earnings, fewer years in retirement, and a higher Social Security benefit so the probability was higher that they could maintain their lifestyle, and have money left over.<sup>2</sup> Also, their hypothetical surplus meant their savings had the potential to last throughout their lives and, also, provide an inheritance for their son and a donation to Ben's favorite charity. Implement Financial planning is beneficial only if you implement the advice. A good coach can help you put your planning into action, trying to help you avoid costly investing mistakes along the way. A financial advisor can help you choose an appropriate mix of investments, adjust your portfolio over time, and withdraw your savings in a tax-efficient way to help realize your goals. Implementing Sally and Ben's financial plan Sally and Ben already had a portfolio that made sense for their goals, risk tolerance, and situation. But where they save—and how they are charged and taxed—also matters. Working with their advisor, Sally and Ben looked at the benefits of a Roth IRA and health savings accounts (HSAs), and also wanted to understand the benefits of charitable planning. Based on that discussion, they decided to:

 *  Convert some of their IRA savings to a Roth IRA. They will need to pay taxes on the IRA conversion, but potentially reduce taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
 *  Try to make the most of their HSAs as a way to save by paying any medical costs out-of-pocket and investing the HSA money for growth.
 *  Donating appreciated securities for charitable donations. By making a direct donation of $50,000 worth of stock that has appreciated $30,000, they could potentially avoid capital gains taxes—and increase the value of their federal income tax deduction from $15,858 to $18,500 (see chart).<sup>3</sup> Manage Working with an advisor can provide a disciplined process for on-going financial planning, regular check-ins, portfolio reviews, and progress reports. An advisor can also help with updates to reflect new goals or life events, as well as manage risk and seize opportunities as markets or tax laws change.

A financial advisor can work for you through market ups and downs—and provide the guidance and encouragement you may need to stay on track to avoid the sometimes costly mistakes investors make during volatile markets. Market moves also create tax planning opportunities. Consider the potential of tax-loss harvesting to help lower capital gains taxes. The rules can be complex. But you can use realized capital losses to offset realized capital gains and, potentially, a small portion of ordinary income. Plus, unused losses can be “carried forward” and used in future years.

Here's how tax-loss harvesting could work for Sally and Ben. Say Sally is subject to a 20% long-term capital gains rate, so she would owe $2,000 in taxes on a $10,000 long-term capital gain this year. But what if she had sold $6,000 worth of stocks at a loss during the same year? Those losses could offset $6,000 worth of capital gains this year, leaving a $4,000 taxable capital gain, and only an $800 tax bill. That’s a tax savings of $1,200 this year, increasing her after-tax gain by 15%.<sup>5</sup>

Of course, you never want tax considerations alone to drive your investment decisions. But if sale of both securities were in sync with your investment objectives, the tax savings would provide a boost to your after-tax return. Managing Sally and Ben's plan Each year, Sally and Ben plan to have 2 check-ins with their advisor. During those sessions they'll review any major changes to their goals or life. So, for example, if Sally has to stop working early due to health issues, or Ben’s mother leaves them an inheritance, their planning could incorporate the changes. During their check-ins, they'll review their portfolio to help ensure it’s still in line with their goals and identify opportunities for tax-loss harvesting and other tax-smart strategies.

Currently, they are wondering if they need to make changes to their portfolio or incorporate different income solutions as they near retirement, including whether to annuitize a portion of their retirement savings.

To help them decide, their advisor provides a hypothetical example, assuming Sally and Ben are now 67 years old and about to retire with $1 million in investments. Going forward, they will be living off their nest egg, and no longer saving. They are looking to their advisor to help them evaluate their retirement expenses and income sources, identify any gaps, and potentially save taxes along the way.

The advisor lays out 2 scenarios. In one, Sally and Ben shift all of their savings to a more conservative mix of 50% equity, 40% bonds, and 10% cash—a common asset mix for retirees—and use withdrawals to cover essential and discretionary expenses in retirement. In the other, they put 20% of their savings in a guaranteed income annuity that along with Social Security will cover their essential expenses, and the rest in that 50-40-10 asset mix. Because they will be able to cover essential expenses with Social Security and the annuity, they can invest the rest of their portfolio for a longer period. Also, the annuity provides some longevity protection for Sally and Ben. Of course, they will want to pick their annuity provider carefully as guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.

If they live until age 93, the second strategy could hypothetically produce more lifetime income, with little concern about running out of money because their essential expenses are covered by Social Security and the annuity.<sup>5</sup> There are also tax-smart strategies for withdrawing money in retirement that could potentially help reduce Sally and Ben's taxes and extend the life of their retirement savings. Some people believe that taxable assets should be spent first, then tax-deferred savings in traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts, and finally tax-free assets in any Roth or HSA accounts. But that is not always the best approach when it comes to your federal income taxes throughout retirement.

In general, for some people without relatively large taxable capital gains, a more tax-efficient strategy may be taking assets from all their account types each year, in proportion to their overall retirement savings. Let's assume that by retirement at age 67 Sally and Ben have $400,000 in tax-deferred IRA assets, $300,000 in a tax-free Roth account, and $300,000 in a taxable brokerage account. Taking a proportional approach to withdrawals during retirement could potentially reduce the taxes they pay on that money by an estimated $24,289 or 28%.<sup>7</sup> The bottom line Financial advice is more than just numbers and investments.

 *  Insurance can help maintain quality of life for both you and your family should you become disabled.
 *  Your financial advisor can help you plan for your long-term care needs. It may be difficult for healthy people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s to envision a time in the future when they need long-term help to care for themselves. Contemplating losing the ability to live independently later in life is also likely to raise anxiety, both about what may happen to you and about the financial implications. That can make it harder to make good decisions—or any decisions at all—about important financial planning issues such as estate planning, your retirement income strategy, or even where you plan to live in your old age.

Andy Reed, PhD, Fidelity's Vice President for Behavioral Science, uses insights from behavioral economics and psychology to understand how people make decisions about wealth and health. He says psychological factors may cause people to postpone planning for a variety of important needs including saving for retirement, college savings, and even for long-term care needs. ""People tend to feel anxious when faced with uncertainty, so they often avoid making plans or decisions when the potential outcomes aren't particularly clear,"" he says.

In addition to the desire to avoid uncertainty, the desire to care for family and other loved ones is also a motivating force during the middle years of many people's lives. Planning for long-term care before it is needed may satisfy both their desire for certainty and their desire to avoid burdening loved ones with the costs and challenges of caregiving. As we age, ""generativity"" plays a bigger role Between the ages of 40 and 65, emotionally healthy adults shift their attention from their own needs to the needs of others, typically their families, and enter a stage that psychologist Erik Erikson called ""generativity.""

""Generativity is characterized by emphasizing commitments to your family and focusing on what you can do for the next generation,"" says Reed. People who feel this motivation can help their families by taking steps to prevent burdening them with the financial and personal costs of providing long-term care. The more you know One first step in reducing uncertainty is to improve your understanding of what long-term care involves and what it costs. Reed points out that many people at this stage of life ""deliberately avoid thinking about the hazy, distant future and the negative consequences it may entail. But gaining clarity and preparing for the long-term is an important part of securing their family’s financial future and achieving the generativity goals they hold dear.""

That is why it's important to know how to recognize early indicators that care might be needed. One sign to watch for is increased difficulty performing the ""instrumental activities of daily living""—or IADLs. These are activities are integral to independent living, including housekeeping, managing money, taking medications, preparing meals, shopping for the household, communicating via phone and email, caring for pets, and being able to respond to urgent situations. Difficulties with these activities typically precede the need for long-term care assistance.

Another part of understanding long-term care is to know the varieties and costs of long-term care as well as what long-term care insurance, regular insurance, and government insurance programs cover. According to data from Genworth Financial, the annual national median cost of hiring a home health aide—the most common type of care arrangement—was $50,336 in 2018.

Higher levels of care, including assisted living facilities and nursing home care, cost more. For example, the national average for a year's worth of care in a private room at a nursing home is $100,375. These are not costs for medical care, but rather for help with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, eating, toilet use, and mobility that people may need to meet their personal needs.

Visit: [What is long-term care?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/life-events/long-term-care/what-is-long-term-care)

The average person needs long-term care for 3 years. Genworth found that only 20% of 65-year-olds who use long-term care insurance to pay for this type of care needed assistance for 5 or more years.

Faced with these costs, some families might prefer to shoulder the burden of caring for a loved one themselves. Seven out of 10 people surveyed by the Nationwide Retirement Institute said they would like to rely on family if they needed long-term care. However, doing so places a significant burden on family members who spend 56 hours per week as caregivers on average. In addition, Genworth's research shows, many find that doing so places significant demands on their lives—and finances—and often requires sacrificing their own families and careers.

Professional care can be a substitute for relying on family. While professional long-term care is not inexpensive, using insurance as part of a plan for care can make a difference in everyone's quality of life as a person ages. The key to good decision-making is to weigh a family's needs against the costs and potential benefits of the options.

In addition to traditional long-term care insurance policies, newer ""hybrid"" policies are designed to provide a benefit even in the event that the policyholder does not file a claim. Be sure to ask about these options when you meet with your financial advisor. Questions to ask your financial advisor Long-term care can be confusing. A financial advisor can help you and your family choose the best way to provide and pay for your long-term care. Ask your advisor these questions:

 *  What will happen to my current retirement plan if I have a long-term care event?
 *  Could I afford to self-insure, and how would I go about doing that?
 *  Are preexisting conditions covered?
 *  What is the waiting period if I need long-term care?
 *  How long does long-term care insurance last and what does my policy cover?
 *  How much does long-term care insurance cost per year?
 *  What happens if I don't need to go to a nursing home or die early?
 *  Can my spouse take over my policy?
 *  Is there a maximum policy benefit?
 *  Will benefits increase with inflation?
 *  Can my heirs inherit the remaining value of my policy?
 *  Can a hybrid policy offer better financial protection for my family?

A thoughtful long-term care coverage decision is all about balance—weighing what you can afford, the kind of care you expect, and the risks you might face. It is not just a financial decision because using insurance may help meet the emotional and physical needs of caregivers such as family members and friends. Made carefully, it's a decision that may help provide you with some peace of mind for your retirement."
53,2631,Why save in a Roth IRA in your 20s and 30s,['Saving and Spending'],['Cash Management'],"['Deposits', 'Retirement', 'Taxes']","['401(k)', 'Annuities', 'IRA', 'Retirement accounts', 'Retirement tools']",Why save in a Roth IRA in your 20s and 30s,Should you have a Roth IRA?,Should you have a Roth IRA?,A Roth IRA lets you balance long-term savings with your short-term needs.,The flexibility of a Roth IRA gives savers some options.,A Roth IRA lets you balance long-term savings with your short-term needs—it makes sense to take advantage of it when you're young.," Key takeaways  *  Roth IRAs offer flexibility. You can withdraw your original contributions anytime with no penalty or taxes due.
 *  Withdrawing earnings before age 59½ could result in taxes and a 10% penalty, but there are some exceptions.
 *  Ideally your money will stay invested in the account—potentially growing for decades. Then all of the earnings in the account can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.<sup>1</sup>
 *  Your income determines your ability to contribute to a Roth. In tax-year 2018, the income cutoff (based on MAGI) is $135,000 for single filers and $199,000 for married filing jointly. In tax-year 2019, the cutoff is $137,000 for single filers and $203,000 for joint filers.<sup>2</sup> Retirement is far away—you may wonder if it really makes sense to lock your money up in a special retirement account when you're young. While it is true that retirement accounts come with some rules, the Roth IRA has some unique benefits that could help you save for the future—and access the money you put into the account when you really need to. Roth IRAs offer flexibility When you deposit money, or contribute, to a Roth IRA, the money goes in after income taxes have been paid. You're allowed to pull that money out of the account at any time—with no taxes and no penalties.

However, if you were to withdraw any earnings (growth and appreciation on investments) on your contributions before age 59½, you would probably have to pay income tax on the withdrawal and a 10% penalty. After age 59½ your withdrawals would be known as qualified distributions as long as another rule is satisfied: the 5-year aging rule, which applies to all withdrawals of earnings, even if you're over 59½. The 5-year aging rule requires you to wait 5 years after your first Roth IRA contribution before you can withdraw earnings tax-free in retirement or qualify for an exception to the 10% penalty.

Given this, it could make sense to contribute to a Roth early in life to give you more flexibility if you decide to tap into your earnings before retirement age. While you may not plan to do so, getting the 5-year rule out of the way could give you more options down the road—like if you decide you want to use a portion of your IRA for a big expense like a down payment on a home or paying for part of an education. Penalty-free withdrawals to buy a first home or pay for education Nearly everyone has to pay for these big-ticket items at some point: a home and an education (your own or someone else's). With a Roth IRA you may be able to withdraw both contributions and earnings at any age with no penalty if the money is used for one, or both, of those expenses.

First-time home buyers, or home buyers who haven't owned a home for at least 2 years, may be able to withdraw up to $10,000 of earnings from a Roth IRA with no penalty. If you've satisfied the 5-year rule, earnings can be withdrawn without paying taxes or the penalty. If it hasn't been 5 years since your first Roth contribution, you would owe taxes on the earnings withdrawn, but not the 10% penalty.

You can also use Roth IRA money to pay for qualified educational expenses, like paying for college or graduate school for yourself, your spouse, or your children. In this case, you can withdraw earnings penalty-free (but not tax-free) as long as the 5-year rule has been satisfied.

If you do choose to take money out of your Roth IRA before retirement, do what you can to replenish your account with future contributions. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement After age 59½, no taxes will be due when you take money out of the account—contributions or earnings. (Again, as long as the 5-year rule has been satisfied.) That's a potentially powerful benefit for a couple of reasons:

1.  If you invest for growth, your money has a chance to earn a return and your investments could appreciate in value. Depending on how you invest and the performance of the stock market, it could add up to a substantial amount. Remember: As long as you follow the rules, earnings are tax-free.
2.  Potentially paying income tax at the lower rate you owe today in your 20s or 30s could help you save on taxes in the long run. Ideally, it would work like this: Taxes are paid now and money put into a Roth IRA. Over the years, if all goes well, your salary will go up and the amount of taxes you pay will go up as well. Once you're in your 60s, you may be in a higher tax bracket than you were in your 20s. With a Roth IRA, you get tax-free income in your golden years when you have the time to do everything you want.

And, who knows? You could be so successful that you don't even need to touch your Roth IRA savings. In that case, with a Roth IRA, you're in luck—you don't need to take required minimum distributions, as you do with a traditional IRA or 401(k). You can withdraw and use the money when you're ready, or you could choose to leave money to your heirs income tax-free. Take advantage of a Roth early The ability to contribute to a Roth phases out at higher incomes. In 2018, for single taxpayers, the phaseout starts at $120,000 in modified adjusted gross income (or MAGI). If your MAGI is over $135,000 you won't be able to put money into a Roth. For taxpayers who file as married, the limits are between $189,000 and $199,000.<sup>2</sup> In 2019, the cutoff is $137,000 for single filers and $203,000 for joint filers.

So, the time to take advantage of a Roth IRA is while you're young: Your income is lower than it may be later in your career, and your savings have plenty of time to grow.

Even if you can only save a little bit, small amounts can really add up over time. In fact, time is nearly as important to long-term saving success as the amount you're able to save. If you begin saving and investing early in your career, the total amount you need to save throughout your life will be much less than it would be if you had started later.

When you add in the potential tax-free growth and compounding the Roth IRA offers, your regular savings have the potential to snowball into a significant amount of money—and that can help give you the freedom to live your life the way you want in the future. Time is on your side. Make the most of it by saving for the future while you're young."

| Industry studies estimate that professional financial advice can add between 1.5% and 4% to portfolio returns over the long term, depending on the time period and how returns are calculated.<sup>1</sup>  A one-on-one relationship with an advisor is not just about money management. A financial advisor can help provide ongoing financial planning so you can have peace of mind while pursuing your life goals.  The financial planning process includes defining your goals, understanding your current situation, and identifying the key steps to move forward.  Beyond long-term goals like retirement, and shorter-term ones like buying a house, education, or travel, holistic financial planning can also include legacy planning, family support, health care, insurance, and charitable giving. |  | When we make big decisions in life, most of us look for a source of expertise and guidance to help us make thoughtful choices to meet our individual goals and needs.

That's what professional financial advice is all about. Ongoing financial planning can pay off in many ways. Industry studies estimate that financial advice can add between 1.5% and 4% to account growth over extended periods.<sup>1</sup>

Of course, the value of advice varies greatly. For one thing, financial advice can mean very different things to different people. For some investors, online financial planning tools or a single investment solution may meet their needs. For others, including people with more wealth, complex situations, or those who put more value on having a personal advisor, a one-on-one relationship with a financial advisor may be a better fit. In addition, the value of financial advice will vary over different time periods, depending on the personal circumstances, market conditions, and more.

For most investors who choose to work with an advisor, advice is not just about investments. More than half of all investors said that ongoing financial planning and coaching services were the most valuable part of their advisor relationship. In this special report, we bring some aspects of an ongoing financial planning relationship to life through Sally and Ben, a hypothetical couple.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  |
| ![Sally and Ben](/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/images/Viewpoints/II/sally_ben375w.jpg)  **Sally & Ben** **Age:** 55 **Savings and investments:** $1,000,000 **Income:** $250,000 per year (total) **Goals:** Support their son, maintain lifestyle during retirement, leave a legacy to a local charity |  | Plan Everyone has goals and an advisor can work with you to understand those goals, model and quantify your options, confirm the steps you are taking and illustrate alternative plans to get you there. Over time, holistic planning may include retirement, housing, education, travel, family support, charity, and more. Sally and Ben's financial planning When Sally and Ben first met with their advisor, he coached them to focus their attention on their major goals—and where they stood on the road to realizing them. Sally and Ben were considering how to help their 24-year-old son, create income in retirement, and manage the impact of taxes. Their advisor worked with Sally and Ben to create a picture of their current financial situation, helping them pull together all needed documents and to develop a balance sheet. Sally and Ben and their advisor agreed to an agenda of items they would tackle as next steps.

At the next meeting they reviewed their balance sheet, beneficiary designations, asset allocation, and progress toward their goals. Their advisor used financial assumptions and the details of their situation to project their current cash flow and get a sense of their retirement planning.

During their initial conversation, they were surprised to discover that Sally wanted to retire with Ben at age 62 while Ben was expecting both to work until age 67. Ben and Sally learned, according to the hypothetical projections, that by retiring at age 62 there was about a 10% probability they could run out of money by 2052, when they’d be 89 years old. While that level of risk might have been acceptable to some, both Sally and Ben have a family history of long lives, and the couple wasn't comfortable with this risk that they would outlive their savings.

Instead, by waiting until age 67 to retire, they’d have more years of savings and compounded earnings, fewer years in retirement, and a higher Social Security benefit so the probability was higher that they could maintain their lifestyle, and have money left over.<sup>2</sup> Also, their hypothetical surplus meant their savings had the potential to last throughout their lives and, also, provide an inheritance for their son and a donation to Ben's favorite charity. Implement Financial planning is beneficial only if you implement the advice. A good coach can help you put your planning into action, trying to help you avoid costly investing mistakes along the way. A financial advisor can help you choose an appropriate mix of investments, adjust your portfolio over time, and withdraw your savings in a tax-efficient way to help realize your goals. Implementing Sally and Ben's financial plan Sally and Ben already had a portfolio that made sense for their goals, risk tolerance, and situation. But where they save—and how they are charged and taxed—also matters. Working with their advisor, Sally and Ben looked at the benefits of a Roth IRA and health savings accounts (HSAs), and also wanted to understand the benefits of charitable planning. Based on that discussion, they decided to:

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  |
| Convert some of their IRA savings to a Roth IRA. They will need to pay taxes on the IRA conversion, but potentially reduce taxes on withdrawals in retirement.  Try to make the most of their HSAs as a way to save by paying any medical costs out-of-pocket and investing the HSA money for growth.  Donating appreciated securities for charitable donations. By making a direct donation of $50,000 worth of stock that has appreciated $30,000, they could potentially avoid capital gains taxes—and increase the value of their federal income tax deduction from $15,858 to $18,500 (see chart).<sup>3</sup> |  | Manage Working with an advisor can provide a disciplined process for on-going financial planning, regular check-ins, portfolio reviews, and progress reports. An advisor can also help with updates to reflect new goals or life events, as well as manage risk and seize opportunities as markets or tax laws change.

A financial advisor can work for you through market ups and downs—and provide the guidance and encouragement you may need to stay on track to avoid the sometimes costly mistakes investors make during volatile markets. Market moves also create tax planning opportunities. Consider the potential of tax-loss harvesting to help lower capital gains taxes. The rules can be complex. But you can use realized capital losses to offset realized capital gains and, potentially, a small portion of ordinary income. Plus, unused losses can be “carried forward” and used in future years.

Here's how tax-loss harvesting could work for Sally and Ben. Say Sally is subject to a 20% long-term capital gains rate, so she would owe $2,000 in taxes on a $10,000 long-term capital gain this year. But what if she had sold $6,000 worth of stocks at a loss during the same year? Those losses could offset $6,000 worth of capital gains this year, leaving a $4,000 taxable capital gain, and only an $800 tax bill. That’s a tax savings of $1,200 this year, increasing her after-tax gain by 15%.<sup>5</sup>

Of course, you never want tax considerations alone to drive your investment decisions. But if sale of both securities were in sync with your investment objectives, the tax savings would provide a boost to your after-tax return. Managing Sally and Ben's plan Each year, Sally and Ben plan to have 2 check-ins with their advisor. During those sessions they'll review any major changes to their goals or life. So, for example, if Sally has to stop working early due to health issues, or Ben’s mother leaves them an inheritance, their planning could incorporate the changes. During their check-ins, they'll review their portfolio to help ensure it’s still in line with their goals and identify opportunities for tax-loss harvesting and other tax-smart strategies.

Currently, they are wondering if they need to make changes to their portfolio or incorporate different income solutions as they near retirement, including whether to annuitize a portion of their retirement savings.

To help them decide, their advisor provides a hypothetical example, assuming Sally and Ben are now 67 years old and about to retire with $1 million in investments. Going forward, they will be living off their nest egg, and no longer saving. They are looking to their advisor to help them evaluate their retirement expenses and income sources, identify any gaps, and potentially save taxes along the way.

The advisor lays out 2 scenarios. In one, Sally and Ben shift all of their savings to a more conservative mix of 50% equity, 40% bonds, and 10% cash—a common asset mix for retirees—and use withdrawals to cover essential and discretionary expenses in retirement. In the other, they put 20% of their savings in a guaranteed income annuity that along with Social Security will cover their essential expenses, and the rest in that 50-40-10 asset mix. Because they will be able to cover essential expenses with Social Security and the annuity, they can invest the rest of their portfolio for a longer period. Also, the annuity provides some longevity protection for Sally and Ben. Of course, they will want to pick their annuity provider carefully as guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.

If they live until age 93, the second strategy could hypothetically produce more lifetime income, with little concern about running out of money because their essential expenses are covered by Social Security and the annuity.<sup>5</sup> There are also tax-smart strategies for withdrawing money in retirement that could potentially help reduce Sally and Ben's taxes and extend the life of their retirement savings. Some people believe that taxable assets should be spent first, then tax-deferred savings in traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts, and finally tax-free assets in any Roth or HSA accounts. But that is not always the best approach when it comes to your federal income taxes throughout retirement.

In general, for some people without relatively large taxable capital gains, a more tax-efficient strategy may be taking assets from all their account types each year, in proportion to their overall retirement savings. Let's assume that by retirement at age 67 Sally and Ben have $400,000 in tax-deferred IRA assets, $300,000 in a tax-free Roth account, and $300,000 in a taxable brokerage account. Taking a proportional approach to withdrawals during retirement could potentially reduce the taxes they pay on that money by an estimated $24,289 or 28%.<sup>7</sup> The bottom line Financial advice is more than just numbers and investments. It's a process that can help you make a plan, chart your progress, and hopefully achieve your personal and financial goals—while feeling more confident along the way."

| Stock prices fell sharply late last year, as investors may have priced in bad news.  Some Fidelity managers have been looking for value in bank stocks hit hard by recent volatility.  Some Fidelity managers are digging deeper into conglomerates to look for investment potential. |  | Rising short-term interest rates and a flattening yield curve have boosted volatility in recent months. We asked 3 Fidelity portfolio managers if they thought December's selloffs left some dividend-paying stocks presenting compelling values, even after the market's 2019 bounce. Their answer: yes—in a wide variety of sectors. A mall operator priced for bad news Adam Kramer is the lead manager of Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund (FMSDX) and Fidelity Advisor Multi-Asset Income Fund (FWATX), and co-manager of Fidelity Strategic Dividend and Income Fund (FSDIX) and Fidelity Strategic Income Fund (FADMX). He thinks investors priced enough bad news into equities over the last quarter of 2018 to make dividend-paying stocks more attractive than high-yield bonds. In response, the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund boosted its exposure to dividend equities.

Kramer sees upside in the industrials, pharma, technology, energy, materials, financials, and MLP sectors. He also likes some names in the REIT space. Kramer believes that too much pessimism is priced into the brick-and-mortar retail space in the age of e-tail. As one example of this trend, Kramer points to mall property owner Simon Property Group’s (SPG) stock performance over roughly the last 3 years.\* During this period, Simon has grown its dividend by about 25%, yet he says investors have given no credit to the company’s valuation, as reflected by the sub-1% annualized total return on the stock.

Today, the stock has had a growing dividend yield, which reached 4.7%, and an overall valuation that offered a healthy downside cushion relative to the value of its real estate, according to Kramer. Simon Property's dividend yield was recently a full 2 percentage points higher than the 10-year Treasury's. That’s near the high end of SPG's yield premium from 2010 through 2018, when it ranged between zero and 2.5 percentage points. Kramer believes the current spread is too wide, in part because malls have begun to transform themselves into lifestyle destinations as big-box retailers have shut down and e-commerce continues to be integrated into brick-and-mortar retail.

Through January 31, 2019, Kramer has added Simon Properties stock to the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund (FMSDX), because he believes it fits the fund's mandate of searching for an attractive yield with a large valuation cushion for error, which can eventually lead to outsized gains relative to other income-oriented asset classes in which the fund can invest.

""I think investors are ignoring the transformational and cash generation elements of the firm,"" he says. Another look at bank stocks ""Recent market volatility hit bank stocks too hard, in my view,"" says John Sheehy, lead portfolio manager of Fidelity Equity Dividend Income Fund (FEQTX). Sheehy says that banks have suffered largely because of the flattening yield curve, in which short-term interest rates rise relative to longer-term rates. He notes that flat yield curves tend to hurt banking profits, and contribute to investor pessimism about both the financial sector and the broader US economy.

A complete inversion of the yield curve occurs when yields on shorter-maturity bonds are higher than those on longer-maturity bonds. The curve inverted very slightly recently, when the 1-year and 5-year Treasury notes yielded 2.56% and 2.47%, respectively, as of late February. An inverted yield curve has often signaled pending recessions in the past. That said, Sheehy points out that recessions historically have lagged inversions—in some cases by several years.

He notes that most US banks have very healthy finances and responsible lending standards. All things considered, he sees particular potential in banks with strong deposit franchises. Sheehy added to positions in 2 regional banks heading into 2019, PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) and Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), and his fund held meaningfully overweight positions in both stocks as of January 31, 2019. Conglomerates' complexity can hide value The relatively opaque nature of conglomerates makes them prime targets for hidden value, according to Gordon Scott, portfolio manager of Fidelity Advisor Dividend Growth Fund (FADAX).

""Conglomerates tend to be complex, hard-to-analyze businesses, which I think creates a recipe for me and analysts at Fidelity to find value that may go unrecognized by others,"" he says.

Scott considers General Electric (GE) a prime example of a company with so many businesses and moving parts that it can be difficult for investors to understand the total picture. GE represented the Dividend Growth Fund's third-largest holding as of January 31, 2019, after Scott added to the fund's position in the fourth quarter.

According to Scott, the scale and complexity of conglomerates can make it difficult for investors to pin down and analyze a firm's problems. In GE's case, he believes the firm addressed substantial challenges in 2018, including its long-term care insurance liabilities and declining earnings in its power segment.

In light of the significant decline in GE's stock price, Scott believes investors may be missing the value of GE's growing health care and aviation businesses. He sees the company’s announced sale of a small portion of its health care segment for more than $20 billion as a step toward unlocking its value. Further, Scott believes new CEO Larry Culp's background acquiring and improving businesses at Danaher makes him well-suited to maximizing value.

For another example of a misunderstood conglomerate, Scott points to Spectrum Brands Holdings (SPB)—another position he's increased in recent months. The firm provides consumer batteries, building hardware, small appliances, specialty pet supplies and auto-care products. Spectrum holds significant debts, which may have made investors wary recently. The company in January closed deals to sell its battery and auto-care businesses; Scott believes the proceeds will enable management to reduce the firm's debt load substantially, potentially benefiting the stock.

 *  People with high incomes generally can’t contribute directly to Roth IRAs due to income limits on eligibility.
 *  Contributing to a traditional IRA and converting to a Roth IRA is one way for higher income taxpayers to take advantage of a Roth IRA.
 *  You can also convert 401(k) balances to a Roth IRA—usually after you leave the employer who provided the 401(k). The Roth IRA offers great potential tax advantages—tax-free investment growth with no taxes on withdrawals in retirement.<sup>1</sup> Plus Roth IRAs have no required minimum distributions, making them an attractive vehicle for tax-smart estate planning.

*But,* not everybody can make a direct contribution to a Roth IRA because of income limits on eligibility.<sup>2</sup> The good news: Upper-income taxpayers aren't left out in the cold. They can still benefit from a Roth IRA if they're willing to take 1 of 2 indirect routes to get there: converting either traditional IRA or 401(k) dollars to a Roth IRA. Roth IRA basics Unlike a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA doesn't provide a tax benefit today: Contributions are made after taxes have been paid. But once the account holder turns age 59½, assuming the first contribution has been in the Roth for at least 5 years, withdrawals are considered qualified. That means that any withdrawals—of contributions *and* investment earnings—are free of income taxes.

And unlike a traditional IRA, there are no required minimum distributions in a Roth IRA (at least during the life of the original owner), so there is no time limit on how long the funds can potentially grow on a tax-advantaged basis. This is especially meaningful to those planning to leave Roth assets to their heirs.

Under the basic rules for both traditional and Roth IRAs, you can contribute up to $5,500 for tax year 2018 and up to $6,000 for 2019, collectively across all of your IRAs, assuming you have at least that much earned income. An additional $1,000 ""catch-up"" contribution is available to taxpayers who are at least age 50 by December 31.

Not everyone can contribute directly to a Roth IRA. For single taxpayers, eligibility phases out for modified adjusted gross incomes (MAGIs) between $120,000 and $135,000 for the 2018 tax year. If you are married filing jointly, the phaseout is between $189,000 and $199,000 for 2018. In 2019, eligibility phases out between $122,000 and $137,000 for single taxpayers and between $193,000 and $203,000 for a married couple filing jointly.

However, these taxpayers can still contribute to a Roth indirectly by converting money in a traditional IRA or 401(k) into a Roth IRA. There are no income limits on Roth conversions and no limits to how much you can convert, as long as you pay any required taxes. Converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA Converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA lets you transfer all or a portion of your traditional accounts into a Roth IRA. But it comes with a tax bill. Because contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, income taxes are typically due on distributions from the account—and that includes conversions. You would have to pay income taxes on all of the pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred investment earnings transferred to the Roth account.

You can also make nondeductible contributions to an IRA and then convert them to Roth. Converting a nondeductible IRA contribution to a Roth IRA You may know that if you or your spouse have a retirement plan available at work, it limits the deductible contributions you can make to a traditional IRA.<sup>3</sup> If you're in that boat and want to make the most of your tax-advantaged saving options, you can still make nondeductible IRA contributions. Earnings on these contributions will be tax-deferred but you do have the option of converting to a Roth IRA. In that case, your nondeductible contributions won’t be taxed again, although any earnings on them would be treated as pre-tax balances which means they would be taxable when converted.

""This type of conversion is sometimes called a backdoor Roth IRA,"" says Matt Kenigsberg, vice president of investment and tax solutions at Fidelity.

If you do decide to convert, the timing can be a little bit tricky. Some time should pass between the date of the contribution and the date of the conversion, but it's not completely clear how much is enough. If you do decide to convert, consult with your tax advisor first to ensure that you understand the full scope of potential tax consequences. If you have more than one IRA: IRA aggregation rule and pro rata rule When it comes to conversions and distributions, the IRS views all of your traditional IRAs as one account. If you have 3 traditional IRAs and a rollover IRA spread across different financial institutions, the IRS would lump all of them together. It's called the IRA aggregation rule and it can complicate your conversion to a Roth—or make it more costly than you may have anticipated.

If you have existing IRAs, like a rollover for instance, and also want to make nondeductible contributions and later convert them to Roth, you won't be able to convert only the after-tax balance. The conversion must be done pro rata—or proportionally split between your after-tax and pre-tax balances, including contributions and earnings.

For instance, let's say you have an existing traditional IRA worth $10,000. You've just made a nondeductible contribution to a new IRA in the amount of $5,000 and plan to convert it to a Roth IRA. You can convert $5,000 of your IRA dollars but you would have to pay taxes on about $3,333 of the money being converted.

Total IRA balance: $15,000
After-tax IRA balance: $5,000

$5,000 is one-third of your total IRA balance. That means that one-third of your conversion will be after-tax dollars and two-thirds will be pre-tax dollars.

There is some potential good news if you only want to convert after-tax IRA balances to a Roth IRA and leave any pre-tax IRA balances as they are. If you have a retirement plan at work, like a 401(k), you may be able to roll your existing IRAs into it. Any after-tax IRA balances would be ineligible to be rolled into your plan. The after-tax balances would thus be the only remaining balances in your IRA, and they could potentially then be converted to a Roth without incurring any tax liability, assuming there isn't any growth in the account’s value between the time of the roll to the 401(k) and the conversion. The only catch is that the workplace plan has to allow this type of rollover.

It may sound complicated but the silver lining is that after converting, any future earnings in your Roth IRA will be free from taxes as long as the rules are followed. You can withdraw the money in retirement tax-free, or let your Roth account grow without taking required minimum distributions. Converting a 401(k) to a Roth IRA You can also convert traditional 401(k) balances to a Roth IRA. Generally, you'll only be able to transfer a 401(k) to a Roth IRA once you've left the company that provided the 401(k) or once you have reached the age of 59½ which is the age most plans allow for in-service withdrawals. That's not always the case, however, so check the rules of your employer's 401(k) plan.

Another option that may be available to you: an in-plan Roth conversion. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option you may be able to convert your existing pre-tax and after-tax balances to a Roth account within the plan. Some employers even offer an auto-convert feature inside their plan. You can set it up so that any after-tax contributions are automatically converted to a Roth 401(k) at regular intervals.

Taxes on a 401(k) to Roth IRA conversion depend on the type of contributions involved:

*Pre-tax contributions only*
If your 401(k) account is composed entirely of pre-tax money (your pre-tax contributions, any company match and/or profit sharing, plus earnings), then you'll be subject to current-year income tax on the entire amount converted to a Roth IRA.

*After-tax contributions only*
If the contributions made to your 401(k) account were made entirely in after-tax dollars, you can roll them directly into a Roth IRA, as long as any tax-deferred earnings associated with them are also distributed from your employer-sponsored plan at the same time to another eligible retirement plan. If this is a traditional IRA, tax deferral can continue; but if it's a Roth IRA, taxes will be incurred on the distribution.

*Pre-tax **and** after-tax contributions*
If you have both pre-tax and after-tax contributions, you may be able to take a partial distribution from your retirement plan, consisting of just one or the other, if the plan separately tracks the sources of all of your contributions. In that case, you may want to roll out only the after-tax source balances and associated earnings.

Even if your plan does not track sources separately, you can still roll over the after-tax contributions directly into a Roth IRA. The pre-tax contributions, along with the earnings from both the pre-tax and the after-tax contributions, can be rolled to a traditional IRA, incurring no current income tax.

Alternatively, you can roll everything into a Roth IRA, paying income taxes on the pre-tax contributions and all of the earnings. However, either way, if sources are not tracked separately, the after-tax contributions along with the earnings on them, plus the pre-tax contributions and their earnings, must be transferred out of the employer’s plan at the same time.

In many cases, the process of rolling out of a 401(k) plan can be a tricky one, particularly when rolling to more than one IRA. So investors should consult with a qualified tax professional to avoid costly errors.

Finally, investors should be aware that taxes are not the only factor when it comes to rolling funds from a 401(k) plan to an IRA, of any type. There may be considerations related to fees, investment choices, creditor protection, RMDs, and other factors that need to be weighed in deciding whether a rollover is appropriate for you. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor before making any decisions.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Rolling after-tax money in a 401(k) to a Roth IRA](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/IRS-401k-rollover-guidance) Roth conversion: Things to be aware of There is at least one important difference between dollars contributed directly to a Roth IRA and those that arrive there via a conversion. It relates to how soon you can access a portion of your funds.

With a direct Roth IRA contribution, you can access the money you put into the account, without fear of taxes or penalties, from day one, no matter how old you are or how long you have held the account. Of course, you wouldn't be able to take a qualified distribution of earnings until age 59½ and at least 5 years after your first Roth contribution—unless you qualified for a handful of exceptions. In contrast, the funds that end up in a Roth IRA through a conversion (whether the source was a traditional IRA or pre-tax 401(k) money) are considered to be ""converted funds,"" as opposed to Roth contributions. In this case, if you are under the age of 59½, you'll need to wait 5 years before you can withdraw that money without incurring a 10% penalty. Note that this only applies to taxable money that was converted; it does not apply to any balances that were not taxable when converted.

Another common misunderstanding involves undoing Roth conversions, also known as recharacterizations. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017, you could undo a Roth conversion. That option is no longer available. If you do undertake a Roth conversion, it's important to understand that you won't be able to reverse it.

There are no guarantees when it comes to tax law, of course. What Congress gives, it can ultimately take away. It's impossible to predict what might happen in the future. So, if the myriad tax and planning benefits of a Roth IRA appeal to you, be sure to consult with your financial and tax advisors."

| Consider spreading the cost of a conversion over a few years.  Consider making a charitable contribution to offset the tax cost of a conversion, and using a donor advised fund.  Managing the tax impact of a Roth IRA conversion requires careful analysis. A review with a financial or tax advisor may be a good idea. |  | The benefits of a Roth IRA are clear: the potential for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals.<sup>1 </sup>But not everyone may be able to *contribute* to a Roth IRA because of IRS-imposed income restrictions on contributions. But anyone can *convert* existing money in a traditional IRA or other tax-deferred retirement savings account to a Roth IRA. And many do.

A Roth IRA conversion does have a cost. Income taxes need to be paid on the converted amount. Taxes are ""front-loaded,"" which allows the money in the Roth IRA to grow tax-free. It also provides tax-free withdrawals for the Roth IRA owners or their heirs.


Here are 2 ways to help manage taxes, one of which combines the conversion with a charitable deduction. Spread the cost A common way to manage taxes on a Roth IRA conversion is to spread the conversion over a few years. This spreads the taxes too, and it may also prevent the income from the conversion causing a bump into a higher tax bracket.

Consider this hypothetical example: Imagine a married couple, the Mullenses, who expect to file jointly with $100,000 in taxable income. They could convert up to $50,000 to a Roth IRA and stay within their current tax bracket, which applies to taxable income between $90,000 and $150,000. (Note: This is a hypothetical bracket for this simplified example only; actual tax brackets will differ, and they may change from year to year). As long as the Mullens' tax rate and income generally stay the same, they could convert this amount yearly until they reach the total amount they want to convert. The potential benefit is that they maintain a consistent tax rate when converting (provided their situation and the tax rates don’t change in the ensuing years.) If they converted more than $50,000, any amount over the current marginal rate income range would be taxed at the next higher marginal rate.

However, things aren't always as simple as they are in this example. Managing the tax impact of a Roth IRA conversion requires careful analysis. A review with a financial or tax advisor may be a good idea. Other things to consider A conversion must be completed by December 31. Estimating taxable income can be tricky without all tax reporting documents, which aren't typically available until late January of the following year, at the earliest. So, your estimated taxable income may end up being higher or lower than expected.

Another challenge: For those near the top of their bracket, it may take a long time to convert the total amount wanted without moving into a higher bracket. For example, for joint filers with $100,000 in taxable income, the next bracket begins at $150,000. Converting only $10,000 would keep the filers within the same bracket. Consider a charitable contribution Tax deductions can help offset the tax cost of a Roth IRA conversion and perhaps allow conversion of a larger amount at a lower tax cost. Among the more flexible of deductions, especially for high-income earners, are charitable contributions.

The tax deduction for a contribution to a public charity can be up to 60% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for cash donations and up to 30% for donations of securities (generally deductible at fair market value when long-term appreciated securities are gifted) in a given year. And if a contribution exceeds these limits, the excess can generally be carried forward for up to 5 years. (Note: These limits are generally applicable, but there are exceptions, and the rules are complex. Consult a tax advisor when considering a large charitable contribution.)

The amount of the charitable deduction available to claim can generally be estimated by adding the taxable portions of a conversion amount to AGI. For example, for those planning to convert $200,000 to a Roth IRA, with a $150,000 AGI before the conversion, the estimated AGI would be $350,000 after the conversion. Up to $210,000 (60% of $350,000) of a charitable cash contribution or $105,000 (30% of AGI) of a charitable donation of securities with long-term appreciation, could potentially be deducted. This could significantly reduce the tax impact of a conversion.<sup>2</sup> An example Consider this hypothetical example (shown right): Richard and Ellen Nettle are considering a large Roth IRA conversion. They have $500,000 in an eligible rollover IRA and $500,000 in a taxable brokerage account—which could be used to pay the taxes on the conversion, or to make a charitable donation. The couple expects that in the coming years their income will be higher, pushing them into a higher tax bracket, so they’d like to convert $100,000 from their rollover IRA at the lowest possible tax cost as soon as possible. The Nettles regularly give to charity and could make a $100,000 one-time gift to charity this year from their taxable brokerage account. The couple expects $350,000 in AGI this year. If they made a charitable contribution of $100,000 of securities from their taxable brokerage account, they could deduct it from their income. The Nettles' combined federal and state/local income tax rate of 40% would apply to the $100,000 Roth conversion, so it would cost them $40,000, which they could offset entirely with their $100,000 contribution.

So the Nettles could save $40,000 in taxes if they make a charitable donation the same year they convert. However, they would need to be able to afford the $100,000 charitable donation—an important consideration. On the other hand, if the $100,000 that the Nettles gave to charity included securities with long-term appreciation, by gifting the securities, the Nettles would also avoid taxes on the realization of those gains.<sup>3</sup> In some cases, that can significantly reduce the effective after-tax cost of a charitable contribution.

This is a simplified example. It's important to speak with a tax advisor as part of a Roth IRA conversion decision, particularly if you are contemplating a charitable contribution at the same time. Consider a donor-advised fund What if someone prefers giving regularly rather than making a single large gift to charity when they convert to a Roth IRA? It may make sense to consider a donor-advised fund, or DAF. DAFs, which are programs offered by public charities, allow a charitable contribution to be made in a given year, and the donor becomes eligible for a tax deduction for that year. Then, at any time, grants can be recommended from the DAF to the charities the donor wants to support. A tax deduction taken in the year of the Roth conversion can help offset the conversion taxes. A large contribution into a DAF can provide a ""ready reserve"" to support many charitable causes over time.

Charitable deductions may be worth more if taxes go up in the future, because they may be deducted against a higher tax rate. Also keep in mind that gifts to charity are irrevocable and final. Conclusion Managing the tax impact of a Roth IRA conversion requires careful analysis. Ideally, it should include a review with a financial or tax advisor to fully investigate the benefits from a Roth IRA conversion and how to execute it appropriately."

But how much can you afford to spend?,Expect to spend 55%–80% of your current income annually in retirement.," Key takeaways  *  If you know your annual income while you're still working, expect to spend between 55% and 80% of that every year throughout retirement, depending on your income, retirement lifestyle, and health care costs.
 *  If you plan an active lifestyle in retirement, expect to ratchet up your annual retirement budget by 6 percentage points compared with a less active lifestyle.
 *  Expect 15% of your living expenses to be related to health care expenses after you retire, year in and year out.
 *  As you near retirement, consider working with an advisor to fine-tune your budget and retirement income plan. If you're like many people, you don't buy into the traditional definition of retirement. You may be planning an encore career or looking to maximize opportunities to travel. Hopefully, new adventures and new activities await you.

But remember, as you redefine your retirement, consider your retirement income plan, mapping it to a budget based on what you expect to spend—or can afford to spend—category by category throughout your retirement.

One of the biggest and most baffling questions you'll likely face is determining what kind of a retirement lifestyle you can actually afford. Some of your expenses will go down, but others may actually go up.

How will you really know the extent of all these expenses before you enter retirement? The good news is this task gets easier the closer you get to retirement if you've already [created a retirement budget](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/budgeting-in-retirement) and explored what your lifestyle will be like in retirement. Then you can turn your ""guestimate"" of retirement expenses into a detailed retirement income plan either on your own or with an advisor.

""When estimating the cost of retirement lifestyles, most people seek to maintain their standard of living, which generally peaks in your late 40s to mid-50s,"" says Steve Feinschreiber, senior vice president of Financial Solutions at Fidelity. ""Fortunately, many people who have saved adequately for retirement can fulfill their dreams because their overall expenses are generally reduced in retirement save one important category—health care."" The 80% rule provides a guideline of what you can afford in retirement For many people, budgeting and estimating future spending is something that they find difficult and tedious. Many simply don't do any budgeting at all—not even trying the ""back of the envelope"" method. We recognize that, so we've taken the approach of looking at what people can generally afford in retirement based on their preretirement income.

If you know what your annual income is today, you can start the planning process by assuming you'll spend about 80% of the income you will be making before you retire every year in your retirement—that's known as your retirement income replacement ratio. So, for example, if your estimated preretirement income is $45,000, plan on spending about $36,000 annually in retirement.

Think about this 80% figure as a good jumping-off point, and then use your income, anticipated lifestyle, and health expectations to modify your number to help you generate an even more relevant estimate of retirement expenses.

""Each family's retirement situation is different,"" says Beau Zhao, director of Financial Solutions at Fidelity. ""The amount of time until you retire, spending habits, travel plans, health conditions, and unexpected costs can all vary dramatically. That is why it is important to adjust the spending guidelines based on your own needs and wants.

""Let's say you plan to travel around the world after you retire. You may want to increase the 80% guideline to 90% or 100%,"" he adds. Determining your retirement income replacement ratio When it comes to planning the income required to meet all your expenses in retirement, one of the big factors to consider is your current income. In general, the more money you make, the smaller a percentage of your working income you may need to replace when you stop working.

For instance, a person making less than $50,000 a year before they retire might need to replace 80% of their preretirement income on average in retirement, and cover $40,000 in expenses. Someone making $200,000 may need only 55% of their preretirement income to help fund a retirement lifestyle that could cost up to $110,000 in annual expenses.

""To get a sense of what you might need to fully cover your expenses, look beyond the 80% starting point. Try to narrow the range between 55% and 80%, factoring in your income, and then adjust your likely replacement income rate to get your number,"" says Zhao. (See the general guidelines in the table below.) How your spending habits change in retirement As people age, their spending patterns change, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Department data.<sup>2</sup> On average, US households under age 55 spend almost $58,000 a year on a wide variety of expenses. Starting at age 55, spending tends to increase slightly, as some younger retirees travel or take on new pursuits. In the age range when most are retired at 65+, there is a significant drop in overall spending (see chart below). The makeup of spending also changes. While spending on food, entertainment, and transportation remains relatively stable, spending on housing tends to go down and spending on health care goes up. Expect to spend less on housing in retirement Many retirees overestimate housing costs. In fact, average housing costs drop over time among retirees, as many downsize, move to cheaper parts of the country (or world), or find other creative ways to trim housing costs or pay off their mortgage (see chart). ""There are a number of housing decisions to consider as you transition from working to full-time retirement,"" says Feinschreiber. ""Work with your advisor to develop a housing strategy—with several different options— as you project where you'll plan to live over the next 20–30 years. Whether you plan to downsize, relocate, or age in place—or consider such options as cohousing or living with one of your children–you can expect your overall housing cost to decline as you age."" Plan for higher health care costs, especially if you live longer Although you may be able to accurately estimate your entertainment, food, and transportation costs in retirement, health care is the one major outlay that is unpredictable and expensive.

Fidelity estimates that on average a 65-year-old retired couple needs $285,000 to spend on health care over the course of retirement<sup>3</sup>. For planning purposes, you may want to factor in an even higher number, because many people experience above-average expenses—often due to chronic illnesses, longevity, or long-term care costs.

**Tip:** According to research by Fidelity Financial Solutions, you should plan on factoring in approximately 15% of your retirement expenses will be related to health care expenses, year in and year out. In general, the more health issues you expect, the higher the retirement income replacement rate you may want to work into your retirement income plans. Your lifestyle choices can impact your bottom line Lifestyle is another big factor to consider in estimating how much you will spend in retirement. You might choose activities that are relatively easy on the wallet, such as spending more time with grandkids, reading, or gardening. But increasingly people want to tap into their savings to create a more active lifestyle that includes travel, adventure, and new activities.

These decisions have a big impact on your bottom line. If you're a jet setter who plans to see the world or take up new activities, expect to ratchet up your income replacement rate significantly. Or if you are looking ahead to enjoying the simple life, this number may be significantly lower.

""We often hear about people who are worried about the stock market taking a chunk of their savings in the first few years after they stop working due to market volatility, asset allocation, or poor market performance. What they may not realize is that their own travel plans could eat up just as much of their savings,"" says Zhao.

**Tip:** Our research suggests if you plan an active lifestyle in retirement ratchet up your overall retirement budget by 6 percentage points compared with a less active lifestyle—a difference that would equate to tens of thousands of dollars in savings at the time of retirement.

 *  Check with your employer about Medicare options when you turn 64. In some cases, they may have negotiated better premiums or may subsidize your premiums.
 *  Medicare costs are a key component in your retirement income plan. Work with your financial advisor to determine which options make sense for you. If you’re like a lot of people preparing to enroll in Medicare, you may be used to your employer picking up most of your health insurance tab. But as you approach age 65, you may be quite surprised to learn how costly coverage can be. According to a Fidelity survey of men and women 55 and older, when asked if Medicare is free, only 43% knew that it was not free. A startling 31% had no idea.<sup>1</sup>

""Not only is Medicare not free, it can be downright expensive. And, it doesn't cover all medical expenses,"" Steve Feinschreiber, senior vice president of the financial solutions team at Fidelity warns consumers. ""You'll likely need a supplemental or 'gap' insurance policy to fill in the payment holes. Otherwise, you are on the hook to pay outstanding balances.""

Before you decide on the plans to buy, research your options to find where you’ll get the best advantages. There are 2 choices for how you can buy Medicare and supplemental insurance:

1.  Through the federal government via Original Medicare. You enroll in Parts A and B, then choose a Part D prescription plan and a separate Medigap policy.
2.  Through an all-in-one Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan. Also known as Part C, this option combines Parts A, B, and D, plus supplemental insurance.

At first glance, it can look like Medicare Advantage plans are much more affordable. But beware the details. You’ll want to look under the hood before you make your final decision. Here are 8 questions to consider before signing up for a Medicare Advantage plan: 1. What are the ""advantages"" of a Medicare Advantage plan? Many people who chose these all-in-one plans like a more packaged approach—and the price. Medicare Advantage plans typically have lower premiums than Original Medicare plus a Part D prescription plan and Medigap policy. Plus Medicare Advantage plans usually cap out-of-pocket spending. In 2019, the cap is set at $6,700 for in-network services. That means you'll pay your co-share costs up to the cap, then your plan will pay 100% after that.

Many add coverage for health care not included with Original Medicare, such as vision, dental, and hearing aids. New this year, some MA plans offer discounts for nutrition services, non-skilled in-home support, and home modifications such as grab bars in the shower or temporary wheel chair ramps that allow seniors to remain at home. 2. How much does Medicare Advantage cost? There is a wide range of costs. Your specific policy will depend on the ZIP Code where you live in retirement, the features you choose, and how much flexibility and convenience you want.

For example, if you live in Fort Myers, Florida, and take 2 generic prescriptions, there are 23 MA plans with drug coverage available. Of those plans, 17 are offered at $0 additional premiums; the other 6 range from $42 to $148 in monthly premiums. Each has different out-of-pocket maximums, different access to doctors, and other varying features. 3. What's the catch with $0 or very low premiums? A network. That's the catch. In order to use most MA plans, you agree to get your standard medical care (not including emergency care) within a specific network of physicians, hospitals or clinics, and pharmacies, and you'll need referrals to specialists. If your doctors are not part of the MA network, you may want to choose another insurance plan. 4. Do I still have to pay for Medicare Part B premiums if I get an MA plan? Yes. You can think of Medicare Advantage plans as primarily supplemental plans. You can choose MA after you enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. A difference with MA plans is in how the payments flow between Medicare, the health insurance companies, and the providers of health care services.

In the case of MA plans, Medicare pays the insurance companies a fixed dollar amount per month for coverage, then the insurer pays the providers a negotiated amount for services performed. In Original Medicare, payments are made to the hospitals or providers for Medicare's share of any covered services you receive. You pay your share of Part B by way of a Medigap plan or from your pocket, depending on the plan you choose. 5. Will I be covered by my MA plan if I live in 2 places during the year? It depends. Medicare Advantage plans rely on a tight network of local providers, typically in one single area. However, some of the larger insurers have set up networks in multiple states. If you live in both New York and Florida, your insurer may have networks set up in both locations. Ask if your MA plan has a ""passport"" feature that allows you access in both places where you live. 6. How do I get covered if I have an MA plan when I'm traveling? Emergency medical is covered under any Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage plan. Your MA plan may include a travel option. Or, you can purchase separate travel insurance and/or a medical evacuation policy for the duration of your trip. Check your coverage with your current Medicare Advantage or Medigap provider along with the [Medicare website](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/travel). 7. Can the cost of my Medicare Advantage plan increase? Yes. Typically, insurance companies assess their pricing policies annually. Your plan will notify you if there is an increase in premiums. Social Security will notify you if there is an increase in Part B premiums. 8. Can I switch to Original Medicare and add a Medigap plan if I change my mind later? Yes. Each year during open enrollment those in any Medicare plan have the option to change plans. From October 15 through December 7, you can switch between MA plans available to you or switch to Original Medicare. Use caution before giving up your MA plan and trying to switch to a Medigap plan. In many cases, insurance companies can charge you a higher premium or deny coverage based on your health history and current situation. For example, if you are a 66-year-old diabetic who has had 2 heart attacks, it's unlikely you'd be a candidate for switching plans. Explore your options Making Medicare decisions is an important part of transitioning into retirement. There are many options and the information can be overwhelming. Get an early start researching your options and finding the plan with the best advantages for you. Follow these 3 steps:

1.  Use [Medicare's Plan Finder](https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx) to:
    \- Compare the various MA plans available in your local area.
    \- Compare the costs of choosing MA vs. Original Medicare with a Medigap policy.
2.  Consider how a provider network will work for you.
3.  Check with your doctors to see what they recommend and which plans they accept. Talk to your employer ""There's one more key step in your planning,"" Feinschreiber adds. ""Check with your employer when you turn 64 to see if there are any other options available when you retire. Your employer or union may offer a Medicare Advantage plan to you when you retire. In some cases, they have negotiated a better premium or will subsidize your premiums. In general, you have the option to sign up for that plan or choose another plan, including Original Medicare.""

**Tip:** It can be difficult to decide which plan will work best for you when you are relatively young and healthy. Ask insurance companies how their plan works when you are 80 and have a host of medical issues—or if you get cancer at 68 or need a hip replacement at 87. No one wants to experience the cost of these medical situations, so it is best to be prepared. Plan ahead Medicare costs are a key component in your retirement income plan. ""Along with deciding when to claim Social Security and determining how you will generate cash flow in retirement, choosing Medicare—including looking at all the Medicare Advantage options available to you—is one key decision you'll make as you approach retirement,"" Feinschreiber reminds us. ""The costs should be mapped into your overall retirement income plan from the beginning."" Work with your financial advisor to help determine which options make sense for you."

 *  Women who annually save 10%-15% of their income in tax-advantaged savings accounts like traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are generally on track to meet their retirement savings goals.
 *  Having an emergency fund of at least 6 months' of necessary expenses can help reduce stress and bring peace of mind. What causes stress in your life? New Fidelity research finds ""my job"" is the \#1 answer for both men and women. But for women of all backgrounds, the next biggest anxiety producers are health and money.

More than 85% of women are stressed about their finances, and 60% are stressed about both their money and their health.<sup>1</sup> The major triggers for that stress are life events, led by divorce, followed by when children leave the nest—and move back in.

""These are times when stress goes through the roof,"" says Kathy Murphy, who leads Personal Investing at Fidelity. ""But our research shows that a few key financial building blocks can have a great impact on reducing financial stress and even improving your health."" *Women: Demand more from your money and health* webcast To help women boost confidence and find the courage to make important money, health and life decisions, Fidelity has produced a new webcast: *Women: Demand more from your money and health*. The webcast features panelists Gayle King (moderator), journalist and CBS This Morning anchor; Kathy Murphy, Head of Personal Investing at Fidelity Investments; and Mindy Grossman, CEO of WW (Weight Watchers).

Throughout the webcast, the panelists talk about the struggles they've faced with their own wellness, challenges they've overcome, and helpful tips for women of all ages to help reduce stress and anxiety while managing their busy lives and families. 3 strategies to reduce financial stress What can you do to help improve your financial security and overall wellbeing? The women in our survey who aren't stressing out over money and health share 3 secrets to success. 1. Build an emergency fund of at least 6 months' of expenses so you can weather the unexpected In everyday life, stuff happens. The roof leaks. The car breaks down. The kids need a cash infusion. That's why it's critical to have an emergency fund, no matter your life stage, gender, marital status, or income.

Overall, Fidelity research finds that less than half of Americans have an adequate emergency fund. Our stress-free ladies break the mold: 77% have one.

If you don’t, here are 3 simple steps to get started:

 *  Look for ways to cut down on nice-to-haves like eating out or buying that extra pair of shoes.
 *  Put savings on autopilot. Set up regular withdrawals from your paycheck to a separate rainy-day fund until you reach your goal.
 *  Explore a side gig to supplement your income.

**Tip:** Save a little bit each week or month until you reach that 6-month target and then you'll feel better about the unexpected. Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [How to save for an emergency](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/personal-finance/save-for-an-emergency) 2. Save at least 10% of your income a year so you are prepared for retirement Taking care of your future self is as important as making time for yourself today. It can give you peace of mind too. Of the financially-zen in our survey, 29% say they have been saving at least 10% for retirement year after year.

To be confident you'll have enough money to maintain your lifestyle in retirement, Fidelity recommends aiming to save 15% each year—but that includes any contributions from your employer. If you are fortunate enough to have one who matches your contributions in a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement account, grab it. That is like free money! And invested well, that money can grow over time.

This year you can contribute up to $19,000 to a 401(k) or 403(b)—and save on taxes too. No 401(k) at work? No worries. You can contribute up to $6,000 a year to an IRA (short for individual retirement account). Lastly, if you're over age 50, you can contribute even more with catch-up contributions.

**Tip:** If you cannot save 10% or 15% at first, try to save at least enough to receive the full employer match at work. Read about all 4 of Fidelity's retirement saving guidelines: [Retirement roadmap](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/retirement-roadmap). 3. Have a financial plan Planning for life's goals—a new house, a vacation, your retirement—is likely on your to-do list. But have you taken the first step?

While 72% of women surveyed say they want to begin a financial plan, only 52% are confident about doing so. Worse yet, 40% of all women say they lose sleep over money matters.

Our financially stress-free women know the power of planning for the life they want and deserve: 95% have some kind of financial plan in place, and 80% have a long-term plan. Why you need a plan Don't think you need a plan? Well, think again.

""Most women will be the sole decision-maker in their household at some point in their lives due to divorce or death,"" says Murphy. ""So it's important that women understand the fundamentals of managing their money. By taking a few positive steps and having these 3 essential financial elements in place, you can make your money work for you—as hard as you work for your money.""

 *  Incorporating securities with these characteristics into a portfolio may potentially mean smaller price drops in down markets but more muted gains in up markets.
 *  Such defensive portfolios may reduce losses in a down market but won't eliminate them.
 *  A more traditional total return portfolio, which seeks to maximize return for a given level or risk, has historically outperformed the defensive approach modestly over the long term but with sharper ups and downs. If you invest, you have to plan for risk. Some investors find market volatility exciting, but for most of us, facing dips in the value of our savings can cause anxiety at best, or worse, drive us to make panic-driven mistakes.

There are defensive approaches you can take to help reduce the impact of down markets on your portfolio, while still trying to capture some of the growth potential offered by investing. But, like most choices, if you try to play defense, you have to face some tradeoffs.

""A defensive investment approach attempts to reduce the impact of falling markets on an investor,"" says Callum Henderson, portfolio manager who works on defensive strategies within Fidelity's Portfolio Advisory Services. ""But there is no free lunch—defensive portfolios aim to limit losses in a down market but will typically trail in a strong up market. Over longer time periods, a defensive portfolio aims to capture much of the growth of the market, but with a smoother ride."" Going beyond asset allocation One of the best ways investors can manage risk is by choosing a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash based on their goals, how long they plan to invest, their financial situation, and feelings about risk. Trying to choose a mix that seeks to efficiently get the most return for a given level of risk is called a total return portfolio. Historically, portfolios that are made up of more stocks have had higher average returns, but also suffered bigger losses during down markets—as you can see in the table. So, your mix of stocks, bonds, and cash is the first step in helping to manage risk. If you are uncomfortable with the amount of risk in your portfolio, you could move to a more conservative portfolio—with a larger proportion of bonds. Historically, a more bond-heavy portfolio has had smaller losses in down markets. But it has also experienced smaller gains overall. Another option would be to try to change your pattern of returns, meaning you try to achieve similar or slightly lower returns over the long term, but with smaller drops and gains—essentially looking for a smoother ride. That's where a defensive portfolio comes in. Defensive portfolios go a step beyond asset allocation, to look for stocks and bonds with specific characteristics that might be able to try to help reduce the volatility of your returns. Making a portfolio defensive There are a number of ways to make a portfolio more defensive. One technique is to target stocks with lower levels of historic volatility or higher quality. Some companies, due to industry, competitive position, or strong financials, have records of lower volatility in down markets. Targeting those stocks can help to limit downside risk during selloffs.

Similarly, within a bond portfolio, a fund manager might select securities that can offer protection from specific risks that seem relevant for a given market environment—for instance, in a higher inflation environment, Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) might help protect the value of a fixed income portfolio. In a low-growth, low-inflation environment, a mix of investment-grade bonds might offer protection from credit risk—the risk that a corporate bond issuer will run into financial problems and be unable to honor its commitment. You should choose your own investments based on your particular objectives and situation. Remember, you may change how your account is invested. Be sure to review your investments decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals. How a defensive portfolio might play out If you are considering a defensive portfolio, you should have an idea of what to expect. To start, a defensive portfolio won't eliminate day-to-day dips in the market. It is designed to help reduce losses in more severe down markets, without giving up much in terms of long-term performance potential.

Let's look at what happened over the last couple of years. During the market run up in 2017, a more traditional portfolio outpaced a defensive portfolio. During the selloff in late 2018, the defensive portfolio suffered losses, but less severe losses than the traditional portfolio. In 2019, the more traditional portfolio experienced larger gains during the market rally. The bottom line Portfolio construction offers lots of potential for investors who are looking to manage risk. A basic option is to adjust your asset mix, but defensive portfolios go a step further, by targeting specific securities with characteristics that have the potential to help smooth out investment potential. Investors interested in defensive portfolios have a range of options, including managed accounts, ETFs, and mutual funds.

""Investing offers a powerful tool for wealth creation, and can help you meet your goals,"" says Henderson. ""But to capture that potential, you need to be able to live with your portfolio. If you are nervous about the markets, a defensive investment portfolio might help you be able to stick with your plan despite rocky markets."""

| A retirement income plan should include guaranteed income,\* growth potential, and flexibility.  Prepare for life's eventual curveballs with a retirement plan that combines income from multiple sources.  Consider working with a financial advisor on your retirement income plan.  \* Guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. This contract is irrevocable, has no cash surrender value, and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date. |  | We all know that there is no one-size-fits-all retirement. You may want to travel the world. Your neighbor may want to garden and read. Likewise, there is no one-size-fits-all retirement plan. Finding the right mix for you depends on a myriad of factors including your savings, expenses, health, family, and values.

The good news is that whatever your situation, you can help improve your retirement readiness (and potentially your retirement lifestyle) by learning about 3 essential building blocks for retirement income plans. Combining them can provide a combination of growth potential, guaranteed income,\* and the flexibility to adjust as your needs change, or life throws a curveball.

We believe a solid retirement income plan should provide 3 things:

 *  Guarantees to insure core expenses are covered
 *  Growth potential to meet long-term needs and legacy goals
 *  Flexibility to refine your plan as needed over time 1. Use guaranteed income\* to help pay for your essential expenses When you create your plan, first and foremost, you'll want to make sure your day-to-day expenses—nonnegotiable costs, such as housing, food, utilities, taxes, and health care—are covered by lifetime guaranteed income sources. There are essentially 3 sources of guaranteed income.

**Social Security:** This is a foundational source of income for most people. When you decide to take it may have a big impact on your retirement. It can be tempting to claim your benefit as soon as you're eligible for Social Security—typically at age 62. But that can be a costly move. If you start taking [Social Security at 62](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/social-security-at-62), rather than waiting until your [full retirement age](http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/retirechart.html) (FRA), you will receive reduced monthly benefits. (FRA ranges from 66 to 67, depending on the year in which you were born.) Find out your full retirement age, and work with your financial advisor to explore how the timing of your Social Security benefit fits into your overall plan.

**Pensions:** Although pensions used to be commonplace, they aren't so much anymore. Indeed, only about 13 million currently employed people have a defined benefit pension plan in the US, according to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.<sup>1</sup> If you're one of those people, you'll want to weigh the pros and cons of how you withdraw the money—as a lump sum or stream of income. If you don't have a pension, there are other ways to create a pension-like stream of income.

**Fixed income annuities**: A fixed income annuity is a contract managed by an insurance company that, in return for an upfront investment, guarantees\* to pay you (or you and your spouse) a set amount of income either for the rest of your life (and the life of a surviving spouse in the case of a joint and survivor annuity) or a set period of time. Generally, there are different types of income annuities you may consider:

 *  immediate income annuity
 *  deferred income annuity
 *  fixed deferred annuity with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB)

Each allows you to buy an annuity now that would provide payments for the rest of your life to supplement retirement income and/or to manage longevity risk. Immediate income annuities begin paying income immediately; deferred annuities start at a date you determine in the future. Fixed payments continue and don't change regardless of what happens in the financial markets.

There are a few things to keep in mind, though. You may give up access to the savings you use to purchase an immediate or deferred income annuity, so you'll need to have other money available for unexpected expenses.

When you purchase a fixed deferred annuity with a GLWB, your future income amount is guaranteed to increase on each contract anniversary for a set period of time or until your first lifetime withdrawal, whichever comes first. You will know how much income you (or you and your spouse for joint contracts) will receive each year at any age you decide to take withdrawals.

Lastly, if you purchase fixed annuities, you also forgo any growth potential for this money; however, you may select an annual increase in payments, called a cost of living adjustment, to help offset inflation. There is no additional fee, because income payments are lower when the rider is elected. In addition, there are options to provide a benefit to your heirs, if that is an option that is important to you.

**Tip:** While each type of annuity can offer an attractive blend of features, work with your advisor to help determine which annuity or a combination of annuities is appropriate for you in building a diversified income plan.

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Create income that can last a lifetime](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/income-that-can-last-lifetime) 2. Seek growth potential to meet your long-term needs As you build your income plan, it's important to include some investments with growth potential that may help keep up with inflation through the years.

You'll want to consider how you can pay for those fun things you've always dreamed about doing when you finally have the time—things like vacations, hobbies, and other nice-to-haves. It's a smart strategy to pay for these kinds of expenses from your investments. That's because if the market were to perform poorly, you could always cut back on some of these expenses.

It's important to consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash that takes into account your time horizon, financial situation, and tolerance for market shifts. An overly conservative strategy can result in missing out on the long-term growth potential of stocks, while an overly aggressive strategy can mean taking on undue risk during volatile markets.

Creating and managing your investments in retirement requires some effort along with the discipline to stay on plan even during volatile markets. You need to carefully research investment options and choose ones that match your goals. You also need to monitor your investments, and rebalance the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash when needed. It’s important to manage taxes on your investments too.

**Tip:** If you don’t have the time or inclination to manage your own portfolio, a professionally managed account might be a better option. 3. Be flexible and refine your income plan over time You want to have a plan that can adapt to life's inevitable curveballs. Five years into your retirement, you might receive an inheritance, have your parents move in, or experience another significant life event. When these things happen, you need a plan that gives you the ability to make adjustments along the way.

That's why it's important to combine income from multiple sources to create a diversified income stream in retirement. Complementary income sources can work together to help reduce the effects of some important key risks, such as inflation, longevity, and market volatility.

For example, taking withdrawals from your investment portfolio gives you the flexibility to change the amount you withdraw each month, but does not guarantee income for life. On the other hand, income annuities provide guaranteed income for life, but may not offer as much flexibility or income growth potential.

**Tip:** Flexibility may also be important when you begin to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) once you reach age 70½. If you're planning to spend your RMDs to cover your ongoing retirement expenses, you may want to work with an advisor to determine tax-efficient ways to take those withdrawals, year after year.

**A note on principal preservation**
As part of your overall financial plan, you may also wish to preserve some principal for use in an emergency or to leave a legacy for heirs. You can accomplish this separately from, or in conjunction with, a diversified income plan.

But remember, investments that aim to preserve your principal,<sup>2</sup> such as money market funds, CDs, or Treasury bonds, come with a different sort of risk. These investments generally offer relatively low yields—and your principal might not be large enough to generate enough income from interest or dividends to fund your desired retirement lifestyle. Plus, if you invest too conservatively, your savings may not grow enough to keep pace with inflation. Understanding the tradeoffs as you build your income strategy Everyone's situation is unique, so there’s no one income strategy that will work for all investors. You'll need to determine the relative importance of growth potential, guarantees, or flexibility to help you pinpoint the strategy that is right for you in retirement. Of course, there are tradeoffs. For instance, more growth potential can mean settling for less guaranteed income. With more guarantees, you get less growth potential and less flexibility. Consider, too, your family's history regarding longevity and whether you plan to leave a legacy to your heirs. 5 steps to consider So, how do you get started? Here are 5 steps to consider taking to help create a diversified income plan:

 *  Manage federal income taxes by considering the role of losses, the timing of investments, and investment selection.
 *  Using tax-deferred accounts when appropriate can help keep more of your money invested and working for you—and then you can pay taxes on withdrawals in the future.
 *  Reduce taxes by considering strategies like donating appreciated securities to charity, and funding education expenses using a 529 plan. Some investors spend untold hours researching stocks, bonds, and mutual funds with good return prospects. They read articles, watch investment shows, and ask friends for help and advice. But many of these investors could be overlooking another way to potentially add to their returns: tax efficiency.

Investing tax-efficiently doesn't have to be complicated, but it does take some planning. While taxes should never be the primary driver of an investment strategy, better tax awareness does have the potential to improve your after-tax returns. Morningstar estimates that a hypothetical investor gave up an average of 1% to 2% of return per year to federal income taxes for the 93 years from 1926 to 2018. Let's say a portfolio could earn 8% per year instead of 6%, that extra return of 2% per year on a hypothetical portfolio of $100,000 could result in an additional $1 million after 40 years.<sup>1</sup> This could be one of the best investment decisions you make this year, or any other year. Here are some tips.

There are several different levers to pull to try to manage federal income taxes: selecting investment products, timing of buy and sell decisions, choosing accounts, taking advantage of losses, and specific strategies such as charitable giving can all be pulled together into a cohesive approach that can help you manage, defer, and reduce taxes.

Of course, investment decisions should be driven primarily by your goals, financial situation, timeline, and risk tolerance. But as part of that framework, factoring in federal income taxes may help you build wealth faster. Manage your taxes The decisions you make about when to buy and sell investments, and about the specific investments you choose, can help to impact your tax burden. While tax considerations shouldn't drive your investment strategy, consider incorporating these concepts into your ongoing portfolio management process.

**Tax losses:** A loss on the sale of a security can be used to offset any realized investment gains, and then up to $3,000 in taxable income annually. Some tax-loss harvesting strategies try to take advantage of losses for their tax benefits when rebalancing the portfolio, but be sure to comply with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules on wash sales and the tax treatment of gains and losses.

**Loss carryforwards:** In some cases, if your realized losses exceed the limits for deductions in the year they occur, the tax losses can be ""carried forward"" to offset future realized investment gains. All gains and losses are ""on paper"" only until you sell the investment.

**Capital gains:** Securities held for more than 12 months before being sold are taxed as long-term gains or losses with a top federal rate of 23.8% (versus 40.8% for short-term gains). Being conscious of holding periods is a simple way to avoid paying higher tax rates. Taxes are, of course, only one consideration. It's important to consider the risk and return expectations for each investment before trading.

**Fund distributions:** Mutual funds distribute earnings from interest, dividends, and capital gains every year. Shareholders are likely to incur a tax liability if they own the fund on the date of record for the distribution in a taxable account, regardless of how long they have held the fund. Therefore, mutual fund investors considering buying or selling a fund may want to consider the date of the distribution.

**Tax-exempt securities:** Tax treatment for different types of investments varies. For example, municipal bonds are typically exempt from federal taxes, and in some cases receive preferential state tax treatment. On the other end of the spectrum, real estate investment trusts and bond interest are taxed as ordinary income. Sometimes, municipal bonds can improve after-tax returns relative to traditional bonds. Investors may also want to consider the role of qualified dividends as they weigh their investment options. Qualified dividends are subject to the same tax rates as long-term capital gains, which are lower than rates for ordinary income. (See [Qualified Dividends](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends) for more information.)

**Fund or ETF selection:** Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) vary in terms of tax efficiency. In general, passive funds tend to create fewer taxes than active funds. While most mutual funds are actively managed, most ETFs are passive, and index mutual funds are passively managed. What's more, there can be significant variation in terms of tax efficiency within these categories. So, consider the tax profile of a fund before investing. Defer taxes Among the biggest tax benefits available to most investors is the ability to defer taxes offered by retirement savings accounts, such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and IRAs. If you are looking for additional tax-deferred savings, you may want to consider tax-deferred annuities, which have no IRS contribution limits and are not subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs). Deferring taxes may help grow your wealth faster by keeping more of it invested and potentially growing.

You may already be familiar with tax-advantaged retirement saving accounts.

The United States tax code provides incentives for charitable gifts—if you itemize taxes, you can deduct the value of your gift from your taxable income (limits apply). These tax-aware strategies can help you maximize giving:

 *  **Contribute appreciated stock instead of cash:** By donating long-term appreciated stocks or mutual funds to a public charity, you are generally entitled to a fair market value (FMV) deduction, and you may even be able to eliminate capital gains taxes. Together, that may enable you to donate up to 23.8% more than if you had to pay capital gains taxes.<sup>4</sup>
 *  **Contribute real estate or privately held business interests (e.g., C-corp and S-corp shares; LLC and LP interests):** Donating a non-publicly traded asset with unrealized long-term capital gains also gives you the opportunity to take an income-tax charitable deduction and eliminate capital gains taxes.
 *  **Accelerate your charitable giving in a high-income year with a donor-advised fund:** You can offset the high tax rates of a high-income year by making charitable donations to a donor advised fund. If you plan on giving to charity for years to come, consider contributing multiple years of your charitable contributions in the high-income year. By doing so, you maximize your tax deduction when your income is high, and will then have money set aside to continue supporting charities for future years.

| Understand what types of equity grants you have and know important dates and deadlines.  Partner with your advisor to incorporate your equity compensation as part of your overall financial plan.  If your portfolio is highly concentrated in a single stock, rather than in a diversified portfolio, you risk exposure to excess volatility. |  | Congratulations, you've been awarded equity compensation as part of your overall pay, bonus, and employee benefits package. This can be a great opportunity to build potential financial wealth.

No matter your level of compensation, it's important to see how all aspects of your financial picture fit together, both short and long term. For example, the proceeds you generate from selling shares of company stock might be used to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored retirement plan, pay down debt, make a college tuition payment, or simply diversify your investment holdings.

To help ensure that you maximize your stock benefits, avoid making these 6 common mistakes: Mistake \#1: Not taking the time to understand what you have Equity-based long-term equity incentives come in a number of shapes and sizes, and depending on what you have, you may need to take different action. These awards can represent a significant part of your total compensation—and should be taken into consideration as you build your overall financial plan.

The most common types of awards are:

 *  Restricted stock
 *  Performance awards
 *  Stock options

It's one thing to know what stock and grants you've been awarded, but do you understand how these awards work? Are you familiar with your vesting schedules? Expiration dates? Payout rules? Separation rules? Blackout periods?

There's a lot to learn so take some time to read about how different equity awards work on the Fidelity [Stock Plan Resource Center](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/go/stock-plan-services/overview). Talk with your advisor about your specific awards to ensure you haven't missed something important. Mistake \#2: Not knowing the stock plan rules when you leave the company When you leave your employer, whether it's due to a new job, a layoff, or retirement, it's important not to leave your stock grants behind. Understanding when your awards vest may help you time a resignation. In most cases, vesting stops when you terminate.

For stock options, under most plan rules, you will have no more than 3 months to exercise any vested stock options when you terminate. While you may receive a severance package that lasts 6 months or more, do not confuse the terms of that package with the expiration date on your stock options.

**Tip:** Corporate mergers and spinoffs can cause changes in your awards. If your company is being acquired, you could see accelerated vestings, new awards in the newly formed company, or even a cash payout of outstanding awards. Contact HR for details on your stock grants before you leave your employer, or if your company merges with another company. Mistake \#3: Neglecting the potential impact of taxes on your awards and the sale of stock For many people, the ability to maximize their equity compensation benefits can be affected by tax considerations.

In most cases, equity awards will result in ordinary income tax liability when you gain control of shares, and capital gains taxes if you sell shares at a profit.

**Tip:** It's important to understand when these taxes are triggered, and when tax withholding (if any) applies. Read [Equity Compensation: Tax Treatment Guidelines (PDF)](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/fidelity/equity-compensation-tax-treatment-guidelines.pdf) Mistake \#4: Not knowing the ""in the money"" factors affecting option value A stock option grant provides an opportunity to buy a predetermined number of shares of your company stock at a pre-established price, known as the exercise, grant, or strike price. Typically, there is a vesting period of 3 to 4 years, and you may have up to 10 years in which to exercise your options to buy the stock.

A stock option is considered ""in the money"" when the underlying stock is trading above the strike price. Say, hypothetically, you have the option to buy 1,000 shares of your employer's stock at $25 a share. If the stock is currently trading at $35 a share, your options would be $10 a share in the money. If you exercised them and immediately sold the shares at $35, you'd enjoy a pretax profit of $10,000.

If, however, the stock price in this example fell to $20 a share, your option would be ""underwater."" An option is underwater if the current stock price is lower than the strike price. Underwater options don’t have current intrinsic value, and it wouldn't make sense to exercise an underwater option, because you could acquire those shares in the open market at a lower price. However, if the stock price rebounds, the option could return to in the money status, so it is important to be mindful of the details and your company stock price.

Consider these factors when choosing the right time and optimum price to exercise your stock options:

 *  What are your expectations for the stock price and the stock market in general?
 *  How much time remains until the stock option expires?
 *  If you are within 120 days of expiration, it may be time to act, to avoid the risk of letting the options expire. Check with your employer about any black-out periods (when you are not permitted to sell) or other restrictions.
 *  Will you be in the same tax bracket, or a higher or lower one, when you are ready to exercise your options? Mistake \#5: Concentrating too much of your wealth in company stock **Key question:** How much of your portfolio would you be comfortable continuing to hold onto if the stock price of your company stock was to pull back unexpectedly?

Earning compensation in the form of company stock can be highly lucrative, especially when you work for a company whose stock price has been rising for a long time. At the same time, you should consider whether you have too much of your personal wealth tied to a single company's performance.

Why? If your investments are highly concentrated in a single stock, rather than in a diversified portfolio, you may be exposed to excess volatility, based on that one company. Moreover, when that company is also your employer, your financial wellbeing is already highly concentrated in the fortunes of that company in the form of your job, your paycheck, and your benefits, and possibly even your retirement savings.

**Tip:** Consult with a financial advisor to ensure that your investments are appropriately diversified and read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [The guide to diversification](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/investing-ideas/guide-to-diversification) Mistake \#6: Forgetting to update your beneficiary information As with your 401(k) plan or any IRAs you own, your beneficiary designation form allows you to determine who will receive your assets when you die—outside of your will. When it comes to beneficiaries, it is important to think about the lifecycle of your awards.

Vested restricted stock and exercised stock options are typically held in your brokerage account and covered by the beneficiary associated with this account. Your unvested awards or unexercised options are a different story. If you have made no beneficiary designation, under most plan rules the executor (or administrator) will, in fact, treat this part of your equity compensation as an asset of your estate.

**Tip:** Beneficiaries for stock plans are often designated differently from the brokerage account that houses your vested shares. You may need to complete forms with your employer or send a separate set of paperwork to the plan administrator. Review your beneficiaries for your equity awards—as well as your brokerage and retirement accounts—on an annual basis.

Consider working with an advisor to help you create a financial plan that covers a wide variety of investment, personal finance, estate planning, and retirement goals. If you receive stock grants, your plan should also include strategies to help make the most of your total compensation."

If you're like many people, you may still be adjusting to the new tax laws that went into effect in 2018. While rates went down for many people, many itemized deductions were limited. That means it's all the more important to get an early start to make the most of tax-saving strategies before year-end.

Here are 5 timely tips to help get your 2019 tax prep off to a good start. 1. Bunch deductions The new tax laws simplified tax filing for many people by increasing the standard deduction and capping many itemized deductions.

But if you're considering itemizing, to make the most of the potential tax deductions that still exist, consider ""bunching."" That means concentrating deductions in a single year, then skipping 1 or 2 years. This strategy can work well when your total itemized deductions for a single year fall below the new standard deduction. The catch is that this strategy requires having the financial capacity to pack all of your deductions into one year.

Here's how it could work: Instead of making annual charitable gifts, investors may want to give 2, 3, or even 5 years' worth of donations in a single year, then take a few years off. Focusing all donations in a single year can increase the value of deductions beyond the threshold for a single year, and then the larger standard deduction can be taken in the ""skip"" years.

Consider the hypothetical example below. This couple, in the 35% tax bracket, makes annual $10,000 charitable donations. Including those donations, their mortgage interest, and property taxes, their itemized deductions would total $25,000—$600 over the standard deduction of $24,400 for married taxpayers filing jointly in 2019. Itemizing gives them $210 in tax savings versus the standard deduction on their charitable contribution each year.

But, if they bunch 3 years' worth of charitable contributions into 1 year, they would exceed the standard deduction by $20,600. By doing this they can save a total of $7,210 on taxes—$6,580 more than they would save by taking the standard deduction for 3 years. If you're considering a bunching strategy, a [donor-advised fund](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/guidance/philanthropy/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund.html) may be appealing. That way you can contribute several years of charitable contributions in 1 year, making the most of the deduction in that year, but spread your giving over multiple years. A donor-advised fund also lets you keep some control over the way your charitable contributions are distributed.

You can also bunch medical expenses. Medical expenses can be deducted if they exceed 10% of adjusted gross income (AGI).

Bunching may work for people who plan to make annual charitable donations but whose itemized deductions fall close to the new standard deduction. Try our [calculator](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/tools-calculators/charitable-tax-savings-calculator.shtml) to model the potential impact of bunching in different financial situations. 2. Consider a Roth conversion The tax law passed in 2018 lowered tax rates and changed the income thresholds for different tax brackets. But those changes are set to expire in 2025. If you saved money in a traditional IRA, you may be able to lock in today's rates by converting part, or all, of your savings to Roth accounts.

You may also be able to convert your 401(k) to a Roth account. Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Do you earn too much for a Roth IRA?](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/earn-too-much-contribute-Roth-IRA-conversion)

Because you pay taxes on your conversion amounts up front, rather than when you withdraw money, you'll owe no taxes on future earnings as long as your withdrawals are qualified. If you believe that your future tax rates may go up, either because of legislative changes or because of higher future income, a Roth conversion could save you money. Another potential advantage: Roth IRAs don't have required minimum distributions (RMDs).

One strategy is to convert up to the limit of your tax bracket. For example, in 2019, a couple with taxable income of $125,000 would have a 22% marginal tax bracket (which tops out at $168,400). So they could convert up to $43,400 before maxing out of the 22% bracket.

Of course, it's impossible to predict future tax law, but income tax rates are now near historic lows, so it may be a relatively good time to consider a Roth conversion. An added benefit of a Roth conversion is tax diversification. The ability to take tax-free<sup>2</sup> withdrawals in the future may help manage taxes in retirement. 3. Reconsider the 529 For parents, grandparents, and anyone else worried about paying for education, 529 accounts are a tax-advantaged way to help pay for education expenses. The accounts allow savings to grow tax-deferred, and avoid taxes on gains if used for tuition, room and board, and other qualified expenses. The tax law passed in 2018 allows 529 accounts for the first time to also be used for up to $10,000 of primary and secondary school tuition expenses each year.

Before withdrawing money from a 529, discuss your situation with a financial advisor. In some cases, allowing the money to grow and compound in the tax-deferred account would produce greater tax savings than tapping it early. And, in some cases, the timing and amount of withdrawals for college, or other qualified uses, can have financial aid and tax ramifications.

Remember municipal bonds For most people, the new tax rules lowered their tax rates and bills—but not for everyone. For some higher income taxpayers, particularly in high tax states, tax bills are going up. For anyone who is concerned about taxes, now may be a good time to reconsider the role of tax-exempt municipal bonds in their portfolio.

Bond interest is typically taxed at ordinary income tax rates—that's up to 37%, and in some cases there could also be a Medicare surtax of 3.8%. Interest from tax-exempt municipal bonds is generally free from federal income taxes, and in some cases state and local income taxes as well.<sup>3</sup>

That can make interest from tax-exempt municipal bonds an appealing alternative to traditional bonds in taxable accounts, particularly for higher earners. 5. Remember the fundamentals: retirement, RMDs, and tax-loss harvesting Many important tax rules were unaffected by the 2018 tax law, including those governing retirement savings accounts, tax-loss harvesting, required minimum distributions (RMDs), and charitable distributions. Here are some reminders:

**Max out retirement and health savings accounts:** Pre-tax contributions to a traditional 401(k), 403(b), or similar workplace retirement plan can generally reduce current year taxes.

The 2019 contribution limit is $19,000. People over age 50 can contribute an extra $6,000, for a maximum contribution of $25,000. The contribution limit increases to $19,500 for 2020; the catch-up limit rises to $6,500.

Be sure to act quickly if you want to contribute more to your workplace savings plan. The deadline is December 31 for this year's contributions.

A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA offers potential tax breaks similar to those of a 401(k). The maximum contribution for this year is $56,000 or 25% of eligible income, whichever is less. You'll have until the tax filing deadline, April 15, 2020, to make contributions to a SEP IRA for the 2019 tax year.

**Contributions to a health savings account (HSA) reduce taxes too.** The IRS maximum annual contribution limit for HSAs in 2019 is $3,500 for those individuals electing single coverage under an HSA-eligible health plan (also known as an HDHP—high deductible health plan), and $7,000 for those electing family coverage. Individuals aged 55 and older may contribute an additional $1,000 (this applies to both single and family HDHP coverage). Family coverage includes any level of coverage other than self-only coverage, if offered by the employer.

The deadline for 2019 contributions to an HSA is April 15, 2020.

**Take required distributions and consider a qualified charitable distribution:** The deadline for taking a 2019 RMD is December 31, unless you turned 72 this year, in which case you get a grace period until April 1 of next year to make your first withdrawal. Don't miss it—the penalty for missing your RMD from tax-deferred retirement accounts like a traditional IRA or 401(k) is up to 50% of the shortfall.

Want to donate to charity when age 72 or older? Consider a qualified charitable distribution (QCD). It's a direct transfer of funds from your IRA custodian and payable to a qualified charity, which counts toward your RMD for the year, up to $100,000. It's not included in gross income and does not count against the limits on deductions for charitable contributions. These can be significant advantages for certain high-income earners, but the rules are complex—be sure to consult your tax advisor.

**Capital gains and tax-loss harvesting:** A loss on the sale of a security can be used to offset any realized investment gains, and then up to $3,000 in taxable ordinary income annually. You may sell for a loss to offset gains, and then reinvest the proceeds to maintain your investment strategy, but be sure to comply with IRS [""wash sale""](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/webxpress/help/topics/help_definition_w.shtml) rules. Tax-loss harvesting needs to be completed by December 31.

 *  For investors, the late cycle historically delivered mixed results and limited upside for a diversified portfolio—though average results for most asset classes have been positive. During Q4, favorable policy developments—including further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve and de-escalation of the US-China trade confrontation—provided additional fuel to power stock markets to a strong finish in 2019. The global business cycle registered evidence of improvement in some areas, but it remains relatively mature and, against the late-cycle US backdrop, continues to warrant smaller asset allocation tilts compared with earlier in the cycle.

See our [interactive presentation](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/popup/item/RD_13569_30073.html#slide0) for in-depth analysis.

The emerging-market (EM) and non-US small-cap equity segments led the widespread Q4 gains that put an exclamation point on the best returns for global stocks in several years. For full-year 2019, all major asset categories posted strong results. Monetary easing and lower interest rates boosted returns to bonds, and US large-cap equities led the outperformance of US versus non-US stocks. Economy/macro backdrop: Mature US and global business cycles The global economy remains sluggish but is showing signs that conditions are no longer deteriorating. The US is firmly in the late cycle, while recessionary conditions in major European countries such as Germany and Italy may be poised for improvement. Overall, the global cycle remains in a mature expansion, but with hints of improvement in some areas, and of a bottoming in global trade and industrial activity.

The near-term risk of US recession remains relatively low, with declining interest rates boosting housing activity and keeping consumers’ debt service at manageable levels. Tight employment conditions continue to support consumer spending. However, some leading indicators suggest the labor market may be nearing peak levels.

Capital spending slumped in 2019 amid weak growth and trade-policy disruption, although recent sentiment indicators suggest business confidence may no longer be weakening. With companies facing an extremely tight labor market, it may be difficult for earnings growth to accelerate meaningfully without material improvement in the global economic environment. Thus, we expect profit growth to face a difficult expectations hurdle in 2020.

Major central banks re-engaged in extraordinary monetary policy this past year. Government bond yields declined around the world, with US 10-year Treasury bonds dropping roughly 80 basis points. The European Central Bank (ECB) restarted quantitative easing (QE) with 20 billion euros of monthly security purchases, and the Fed began buying $60 billion of Treasury bills monthly and expanded its repo operations to relieve money market stress. These actions drove down real US yields, helped boost asset prices, and provided a positive liquidity environment to start 2020.

Core inflation has remained generally stable at around 2% in recent years, with near-term expectations holding firm. The outlook for oil also is supportive, as prices have generally trended higher in recent months amid inventory declines. Compared to history, the Fed is likely to be more permissive of inflationary pressure, implying an inclination to keep rates at current levels barring a major inflection in growth or inflation.

Global economic policy uncertainty rose to unprecedented levels in recent years amid an unclear outlook for monetary policy, international trade tension, Brexit, and a host of other issues. However, world central banks’ shift to monetary easing and the de-escalation of the US-China trade conflict late in 2019 offered hope that uncertainty may prove less of a headwind for business confidence in 2020. Asset markets: Strong quarter for risk assets, strong year for everything Global stocks finished strong in Q4, led by emerging markets (EM) equity. For 2019 overall, almost all asset classes logged sizable absolute gains, with US growth stocks and the tech sector the top performers. In fixed income, long-duration debt proved the worst-performing sector in Q4 but gained nearly 20% for the year. Riskier credit categories such as high-yield and EM bonds led in Q4 and posted strong full-year results as well.

Earnings growth across all regions finished the year on a weak note. US profit growth continued to slow subsequent to the tax-reform boost in 2018, while non-US earnings growth spent all of 2019 in negative territory. Forward estimates point to market expectations for a significant recovery in earnings growth in 2020, which may be difficult to achieve without a sustained reacceleration of global growth.

Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios for non-US developed and EM equities remained below those for the US, providing a relatively favorable long-term valuation backdrop for non-US stocks. In Q4, the US dollar generally depreciated against many of the world’s major currencies. Nevertheless, US dollar valuations still remain relatively expensive overall.

In fixed income, inflation expectations rose modestly in Q4, boosting yields amid signs of global economic improvement. In the US, risk-on sentiment contributed to modestly higher Treasury rates and even tighter credit spreads across most bond categories. As a result of accommodative global central banks and benign credit conditions, bond yields generally remain in their lowest decile relative to history, and credit spreads in most categories are generally well below their long-term averages.

Late cycle has often involved rising inflation pressure, which has tended to enhance the attractiveness of inflation-sensitive assets such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), commodities, and energy and materials sector equities. Our near-term outlook for core inflation is relatively range-bound, but the market’s expectations (represented by TIPS’ breakeven rates) are at the lower end of their decade-long range, suggesting to us that inflation protection is relatively inexpensive.

Historically, the mid-cycle phase tends to favor riskier asset classes and produce broad-based gains across most asset categories. Meanwhile, of all the business cycle phases, late cycle has delivered the most mixed performance results. Another frequent feature of late cycle has been overall more limited upside for a diversified portfolio, though results for most asset classes have, on average, been positive."

US-China trade talks, earnings results, and central bank actions continue to act as primary market drivers.

If you are looking for new investing ideas, or are reassessing the US stock allocation of your portfolio, this report finds that financials, technology, communication services, health care, and industrials scored more positive than negative marks, based on 3 key factors. Read on to see how the 11 US stock market sectors scored. Scorecard: Improved growth outlook drives Q4 US stock surge Stocks rallied in the fourth quarter, helping the equity market post impressive full-year 2019 gains. The information technology (14.4%), health care (14.4%), and financials (10.5%) sectors led the market in Q4, as investors anticipated a pickup in earnings growth. Our sector strategist believes a potential recovery in corporate earnings growth could boost the market—and cyclical stocks in particular—over the coming months. Fundamentals: Tech, consumer discretionary, health care lead The technology, health care, and consumer discretionary sectors scored highest on the fundamental factors under consideration. Technology ranked first in earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, and free-cash-flow (FCF) margin, and second in return on equity. Health care also fared well on EPS and EBITDA growth as well as FCF margin. By contrast, fundamentals were relatively weak in the energy, real estate, and utilities sectors. Relative valuations: Financials and materials look cheap Financials stocks appeared inexpensive at the end of Q4, as the sector's P/E and P/B ratios were near the lowest ends of their historical ranges. Materials and industrials stocks also looked inexpensive compared to their historical average valuations. By contrast, the valuations of the technology, health care, and real estate sectors appeared elevated. Relative strength: Technology and financials on top Strong fourth-quarter performance helped push the technology and financials sectors into the top spots in our relative strength rankings. Communication services stocks also screened well. Shares in the materials, consumer discretionary, and energy sectors trailed the market considerably in Q4, depressing their momentum as 2019 drew to a close. Bank lending conditions suggest recession is unlikely Bank lending standards can help gauge the direction of hiring, and by extension the direction of the economy. While lending standards have tightened somewhat recently, they have not reached levels that have historically coincided with contractions in hiring. Some metrics suggest bank willingness to lend is positive, and has historically improved after Fed rate cuts. If history is a guide, 2019 Fed easing could lead to more lending and lower odds of recession. An on-hold Fed may buoy equities, especially cyclicals The Federal Reserve has stated that it intends to keep its interest rate policy on hold in 2020. That stance has historically been constructive for the stock market: Since 1983, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 7% during 6-month periods when the Fed has left its benchmark rate unchanged, outpacing its average 6-month return when rates either rose or fell. Cyclical stocks have outperformed the broader market on average during those periods. A strong outlook for small business earnings Small businesses have become more positive about future earnings growth. According to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), most small businesses reported declining earnings for most of 2019—but since October, the net percentage reporting higher earnings jumped into the top quartile of periods since 1974. Amid such strong NFIB survey results, total market earnings advanced 93% of the time over the next 6 months and accelerated 58% of the time. Stocks tend to gain when earnings inflect higher Rebounding earnings have been meaningful for the market historically. When earnings growth has turned from negative to positive as it has recently, the S&P 500 advanced almost 90% of the time. In fact, accelerations in earnings have been more important for stock performance than the level of earnings growth historically. Past earnings accelerations have led cyclical stocks to outperform, especially when the economy hasn’t experienced a recent contraction. Manufacturing may be due for a rebound A global slump in manufacturing has pushed some indicators to contractionary levels: The Industrial Production Index and durable goods orders declined from a year earlier, while the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) New Orders Index was recently below 50 (signaling a contraction). Though it may seem counterintuitive, industrials stocks have tended to outperform the broad market in the 12 months following such conditions. There may be value in semiconductor stocks The ISM New Orders Index weakened in recent years and semiconductor valuations fell below levels seen during prior declines in this manufacturing indicator. The industry had begun to rally in 2019 despite the ISM's downward trajectory, contributing to investor caution. But semiconductors have outpaced the market 67% of the time after the ISM fell below 50 when their valuations were this low—only slightly lower odds of outperformance than when the ISM was rising. Riskier health care stocks may be cheap In health care, the valuation gap between the most expensive and least expensive stocks is much wider than usual. This dispersion may give investors a chance to find value among out-of-favor stocks. Shares of health care companies that have experienced higher volatility, including managed care firms and facilities operators, are trading at an unusually large discount to the rest of the sector, which may present opportunities for value-focused investors."

 *  Read the contract with your card issuer so you understand the terms and check your credit reports regularly.
 *  To make the most of your cards, find out how to maximize points, cash back, and other perks. Credit cards are a way of life. Leaving home unburdened by cash is great—and so is getting a free airline ticket or hotel stay, cash back, or other rewards just for spending money. Credit cards are just so easy and convenient to use. But that convenience has a downside: Credit cards can be the source of debt troubles too. That's why it's important to understand the role of credit cards in your financial life.

""Used wisely, credit is an important tool in your financial toolbox,"" explains Stefan Ross, vice president of credit card products at Fidelity. ""Using credit cards in the right way can help you build wealth and get better loan terms.""

Here are 7 tips to help you use credit cards safely and effectively, and to help you make the most of their benefits. 1. Pay attention to total monthly debt payments Many financial advisers suggest that your total monthly debt payments—including mortgage, car loans, student loans, and credit card payments—shouldn't add up to more than one-third of your income. If you are near that number, you might need to pay down other loans or avoid additional credit card purchases. Having more debt than you can handle could jeopardize your long-term financial goals, such as retirement or saving for a child's college education. 2. Check your credit reports regularly Your credit information is compiled by 3 credit reporting agencies: TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. Their reports are the source of your credit score, which potential lenders use to make decisions about whether to lend to you and what interest rate to charge. ""Your credit score and history reflect your ability to borrow responsibly,"" says Ross. ""Lenders have a risk-reward ratio they follow, based on your credit history.""

Credit reports include the total amount you owe; whether you pay your bills on time; what types of credit you use, such as credit cards, mortgages, and other loans; and how many new credit inquiries you’ve initiated. Errors in any of this information could lead to a lower credit score, which could prevent you from getting attractive interest rates—or from borrowing at all.

So it's important to review your report on an annual basis to check for errors. You can request a free copy of each of your 3 reports once a year at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action). Or, for more regular monitoring, review one report from each agency every 4 months. You are also eligible for a free report if you have been denied credit. 3. Pay on time and think carefully about closing cards you aren't using The most important factors on a credit report are your debt-to-available credit ratio, or credit utilization, and your payment history. So keeping your debt level low and making on-time payments help make you more attractive to lenders. But it's not just negative actions—such as missing a payment or carrying a large balance—that can damage your credit. Canceling an older card can also lower your credit score. The reason: Lenders care about your credit history, and the longer that history the better.

The ratio of available credit to the amount of credit you are currently using is another factor that affects your credit score. Closing down a little-used card will lower the amount of credit available to you without reducing the amount of credit you are using. That could skew your credit ratio and make you seem like a riskier borrower. 4. Read those long policy agreements Not all credit cards are created equal. Some charge annual fees, while others charge fees for balance transfers, cash advances, exceeding your credit limit, or other actions. To keep your fees manageable, choose a card with rates and fee structures that match your expected behavior. For instance, if you can't avoid carrying a balance, choose a card with the lowest interest rate you can find. If you intend to pay off the balance each month, you might look for a credit card with a rewards program, although it may carry a higher interest rate. Also, the days when only banks issued credit cards are long gone. These days, retailers (both online and brick and mortar), brokerage firms, and travel agencies are just some of the institutions that issue credit cards.

To decide which card (or cards) may be best for you, you'll need to read and understand the issuer's credit card policy agreement. Look for how and when your interest rate might increase, what actions carry fees, and how the issuer will charge for overseas transactions. If you still have questions, reach out to the issuer by phone or online. Most issuers have resources to help explain the agreement. 5. Use cards safely Credit card fraud and identify theft are major risks. Most cardholders aren't liable for fraudulent charges on their cards, but you still have a responsibility to keep your information safe. ""Fraud prevention works best when consumers and credit card companies work together,"" notes Ross.

Be proactive to reduce the risk of fraud by reviewing your monthly credit card statements and checking your account online more frequently. Keep your receipts so you can compare them with your monthly statement and charges. Then, notify your card issuer if you spot any transactions that you don't recognize. And, of course, report a lost or stolen card immediately. Many credit card companies also offer text or email alerts when your card has been used. 6. Maximize rewards Credit card rewards—such as points toward merchandise, airline miles, or access to exclusive clubs—are popular. A card that offers cash rewards may also help you save. ""If you are going to be spending money anyway, you might as well get cash back and build wealth from it,"" says Ross.

You can add to your savings by having the rewards automatically deposited in a checking or savings account, or even into an IRA, brokerage, or 529 savings account—if your financial institution permits it. That way, your credit card purchases can actually help you accomplish other financial goals. 7. Pay off balances strategically Thanks to the Credit CARD Act of 2009, credit card statements now show cardholders how long it will take to pay down their balance if they make only the minimum payment—not to mention how much more it will cost. Naturally, the faster you can pay off those balances, the less debt will cost you. If you can't pay a card balance in full each month, review your budget to determine how much you can earmark for that payment without sacrificing other important goals, such as saving for retirement.

Making minimum payments on one card can make sense if it's part of a strategy to pay off higher interest rate cards first—which likely will save you money over time. And because credit cards typically charge higher rates than other types of debt, it often makes sense to focus on reducing card debt before paying off other loans with extra payments, such as a mortgage or car loan. Plus the interest on credit cards, unlike mortgages, is not deductible. That said, it's important to always continue making at least minimum payments on all your debt, so your credit rating will not suffer.

Remember that although you might use credit cards like cash, they are not just a tool for transactions. They can have an impact on your financial goals. Take the time to consider credit cards in the context of your budget, debt picture, and other financial priorities so you can better use credit cards to your advantage. ""Be an educated consumer,"" says Ross. ""Figure out what makes the most sense for your situation."""

 *  Expect to live longer.
 *  Be prepared for inflation.
 *  Position investments for growth.
 *  Don't withdraw too much from savings.

If you're approaching the off-ramp to retirement—or already there—it's important to think about protecting what you've saved and helping to ensure that you'll have enough income throughout your retirement. After all, you worked hard to get to retirement. So you want to be able to enjoy it without having to worry about money. That means thinking ahead and planning for a retirement that may last 30 years or longer.

Here are 5 rules of thumb to help manage some things that can affect your income in retirement. 1. Plan for health care costs With longer life spans and medical costs that historically have risen faster than general inflation—particularly for long-term care—managing health care costs is important for retirees. Retirement planning conversations should include a discussion of the impact long-term care costs have on individuals and their family’s future.

According to Fidelity's annual retiree health care costs estimate, the average 65-year-old couple retiring in 2019 will need an estimated $285,000 to cover health care costs during their retirement, and that is just using average life expectancy data.<sup>1</sup> Many people will live longer and have higher costs. And that cost doesn't include long-term care (LTC) expenses. Having a dedicated pool of monies for long-term care expenses may be an important consideration to cover long-term care expenses, ultimately protecting your retirement income.

As reported by the US Department of Health and Human Services, about 70% of those aged 65 and older will require some type of LTC services—either at home, in adult day care, in an assisted living facility, or in a traditional nursing home.<sup>2</sup> According to the Genworth 2018 Cost of Care Survey, the average cost of a semiprivate room in a nursing home<sup>3</sup> is about $89,297 per year, assisted living facilities<sup>4</sup> average $48,000 per year, and home health care homemaker services<sup>5</sup> are $48,048 a year.

**Consider long-term-care insurance:** Insurers base the cost largely on age, so the earlier you purchase a policy, the lower the annual premiums, though the longer you'll potentially be paying for them. It is also important to research the strength of the company you select, as well as investigate other potential options for funding LTC costs.

If you are still working and your employer offers a health savings account (HSA), you may want to take advantage of it. An HSA offers a triple tax advantage:<sup>6</sup> You can save pretax dollars, which can grow and be withdrawn state and federal tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses—currently or in retirement.

Expect to live longer As medical advances continue, it's quite likely that today's healthy 65-year-olds will live well into their 80s or even 90s. This means there's a real possibility that you may need 30 or more years of retirement income. And recent data suggests that longevity expectations may continue to increase. People are living longer because they're healthy, active, and taking better care of themselves.

Without some thoughtful planning, you could outlive your savings and have to rely solely on Social Security for income. And with the average Social Security benefit for a retired worker currently at just over $1,419 a month, it may not cover all your needs.<sup>6</sup>

**Consider annuities:** To cover your income needs, particularly your essential expenses (such as food, housing, and insurance) that aren't covered by other guaranteed income like Social Security or a pension, you may want to use some of your retirement savings to purchase an income annuity. It will help you create a simple and efficient stream of income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you (or you and your spouse) live.<sup>7</sup>

Read *Viewpoints* on Fidelity.com: [Smart retirement income strategies](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/viewpoints/retirement/retirement-income-strategies) 3. Be prepared for inflation Inflation can eat away at the purchasing power of your money over time. Inflation affects your retirement income by increasing the future costs of goods and services, thereby reducing the future purchasing power of your income. Even a relatively low inflation rate can have a significant impact on a retiree's purchasing power.

**Consider cost of living increases:** Social Security and certain pensions and annuities help keep up with inflation through annual cost-of-living adjustments or market-related performance. Choosing investments that have the potential to help keep pace with inflation, such as growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks or stock mutual funds), Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), real estate securities, and commodities, may also make sense to include as a part of an age-appropriate, diversified portfolio that also reflects your risk tolerance and financial circumstances. 4. Position investments for growth Overly conservative investments can be just as dangerous as overly aggressive ones. They expose your portfolio to the erosive effects of inflation, limit the long-term upside potential that diversified stock investments can offer, and can diminish how long your money may last. On the other hand, being too aggressive can mean undue risk of losing money in down or volatile markets.

An investment strategy (asset mix) that seeks to balance growth potential and risk (return volatility) may be the answer. You should determine—and consistently maintain—an asset mix that reflects your investment horizon, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

The sample target investment mixes below show illustrative blends of stocks, bonds, and short-term investments with different levels of risk and growth potential. With retirement likely to span 30 years or so, you'll want to find a balance between risk and growth potential. **Consider diversification:** Build a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and short-term investments, according to how comfortable you are with market volatility, your overall financial situation, and how long you are investing for. Doing so may provide you with the potential for the growth you need without taking on more risk than you are comfortable with. But remember: Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. Get help creating an appropriate investment strategy by working with a Fidelity advisor or utilizing our [Planning & Guidance Center](https://~%28WWW_HOST%29~/calculators-tools/planning-guidance-center). 5. Don't withdraw too much from savings Spending your savings too rapidly can also put your retirement income at risk. For this reason, we believe that retirees should consider using conservative withdrawal rates, particularly for any money needed for essential expenses.

We did the math—looking at history and simulating many potential outcomes—and landed on this guideline: To be confident that savings will last for 20–30 years retirement, consider withdrawing no more than 4%–5% from savings in the first year of retirement, then adjust that percentage for inflation in subsequent years.

**Consider a sustainable withdrawal plan:** Work with a Fidelity advisor to develop and maintain a retirement income plan or consider an annuity with guaranteed lifetime income<sup>7</sup> as part of your diversified plan, so you won't run out of money, regardless of market moves.

But it doesn't have to be that way if you take steps leading up to and during retirement to manage these 5 key rules of thumb for your retirement income."
